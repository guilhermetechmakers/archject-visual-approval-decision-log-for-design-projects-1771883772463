# Modern Design Best Practices

## Philosophy

Create unique, memorable experiences while maintaining consistency through modern design principles. Every project should feel distinct yet professional, innovative yet intuitive.

---

## Landing Pages & Marketing Sites

### Hero Sections
**Go beyond static backgrounds:**
- Animated gradients with subtle movement
- Particle systems or geometric shapes floating
- Interactive canvas backgrounds (Three.js, WebGL)
- Video backgrounds with proper fallbacks
- Parallax scrolling effects
- Gradient mesh animations
- Morphing blob animations


### Layout Patterns
**Use modern grid systems:**
- Bento grids (asymmetric card layouts)
- Masonry layouts for varied content
- Feature sections with diagonal cuts or curves
- Overlapping elements with proper z-index
- Split-screen designs with scroll-triggered reveals

**Avoid:** Traditional 3-column equal grids

### Scroll Animations
**Engage users as they scroll:**
- Fade-in and slide-up animations for sections
- Scroll-triggered parallax effects
- Progress indicators for long pages
- Sticky elements that transform on scroll
- Horizontal scroll sections for portfolios
- Text reveal animations (word by word, letter by letter)
- Number counters animating into view

**Avoid:** Static pages with no scroll interaction

### Call-to-Action Areas
**Make CTAs impossible to miss:**
- Gradient buttons with hover effects
- Floating action buttons with micro-interactions
- Animated borders or glowing effects
- Scale/lift on hover
- Interactive elements that respond to mouse position
- Pulsing indicators for primary actions

---

## Dashboard Applications

### Layout Structure
**Always use collapsible side navigation:**
- Sidebar that can collapse to icons only
- Smooth transition animations between states
- Persistent navigation state (remember user preference)
- Mobile: drawer that slides in/out
- Desktop: sidebar with expand/collapse toggle
- Icons visible even when collapsed

**Structure:**
```
/dashboard (layout wrapper with sidebar)
  /dashboard/overview
  /dashboard/analytics
  /dashboard/settings
  /dashboard/users
  /dashboard/projects
```

All dashboard pages should be nested inside the dashboard layout, not separate routes.

### Data Tables
**Modern table design:**
- Sticky headers on scroll
- Row hover states with subtle elevation
- Sortable columns with clear indicators
- Pagination with items-per-page control
- Search/filter with instant feedback
- Selection checkboxes with bulk actions
- Responsive: cards on mobile, table on desktop
- Loading skeletons, not spinners
- Empty states with illustrations or helpful text

**Use modern table libraries:**
- TanStack Table (React Table v8)
- AG Grid for complex data
- Data Grid from MUI (if using MUI)

### Charts & Visualizations
**Use the latest charting libraries:**
- Recharts (for React, simple charts)
- Chart.js v4 (versatile, well-maintained)
- Apache ECharts (advanced, interactive)
- D3.js (custom, complex visualizations)
- Tremor (for dashboards, built on Recharts)

**Chart best practices:**
- Animated transitions when data changes
- Interactive tooltips with detailed info
- Responsive sizing
- Color scheme matching design system
- Legend placement that doesn't obstruct data
- Loading states while fetching data

### Dashboard Cards
**Metric cards should stand out:**
- Gradient backgrounds or colored accents
- Trend indicators (↑ ↓ with color coding)
- Sparkline charts for historical data
- Hover effects revealing more detail
- Icon representing the metric
- Comparison to previous period

---

## Color & Visual Design

### Color Palettes
**Create depth with gradients:**
- Primary gradient (not just solid primary color)
- Subtle background gradients
- Gradient text for headings
- Gradient borders on cards
- Elevated surfaces for depth

**Color usage:**
- 60-30-10 rule (dominant, secondary, accent)
- Consistent semantic colors (success, warning, error)
- Accessible contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum)

### Typography
**Create hierarchy through contrast:**
- Large, bold headings (48-72px for heroes)
- Clear size differences between levels
- Variable font weights (300, 400, 600, 700)
- Letter spacing for small caps
- Line height 1.5-1.7 for body text
- Inter, Poppins, or DM Sans for modern feel

### Shadows & Depth
**Layer UI elements:**
- Multi-layer shadows for realistic depth
- Colored shadows matching element color
- Elevated states on hover
- Neumorphism for special elements (sparingly)

---

## Interactions & Micro-animations

### Button Interactions
**Every button should react:**
- Scale slightly on hover (1.02-1.05)
- Lift with shadow on hover
- Ripple effect on click
- Loading state with spinner or progress
- Disabled state clearly visible
- Success state with checkmark animation

### Card Interactions
**Make cards feel alive:**
- Lift on hover with increased shadow
- Subtle border glow on hover
- Tilt effect following mouse (3D transform)
- Smooth transitions (200-300ms)
- Click feedback for interactive cards

### Form Interactions
**Guide users through forms:**
- Input focus states with border color change
- Floating labels that animate up
- Real-time validation with inline messages
- Success checkmarks for valid inputs
- Error states with shake animation
- Password strength indicators
- Character count for text areas

### Page Transitions
**Smooth between views:**
- Fade + slide for page changes
- Skeleton loaders during data fetch
- Optimistic UI updates
- Stagger animations for lists
- Route transition animations

---

## Mobile Responsiveness

### Mobile-First Approach
**Design for mobile, enhance for desktop:**
- Touch targets minimum 44x44px
- Generous padding and spacing
- Sticky bottom navigation on mobile
- Collapsible sections for long content
- Swipeable cards and galleries
- Pull-to-refresh where appropriate

### Responsive Patterns
**Adapt layouts intelligently:**
- Hamburger menu → full nav bar
- Card grid → stack on mobile
- Sidebar → drawer
- Multi-column → single column
- Data tables → card list
- Hide/show elements based on viewport

---

## Loading & Empty States

### Loading States
**Never leave users wondering:**
- Skeleton screens matching content layout
- Progress bars for known durations
- Animated placeholders
- Spinners only for short waits (<3s)
- Stagger loading for multiple elements
- Shimmer effects on skeletons

### Empty States
**Make empty states helpful:**
- Illustrations or icons
- Helpful copy explaining why it's empty
- Clear CTA to add first item
- Examples or suggestions
- No "no data" text alone

---

## Unique Elements to Stand Out

### Distinctive Features
**Add personality:**
- Custom cursor effects on landing pages
- Animated page numbers or section indicators
- Unusual hover effects (magnification, distortion)
- Custom scrollbars
- Glassmorphism for overlays
- Animated SVG icons

 for bestpractices and # 404 Not Found

## Overview
Create a user-friendly 404 Not Found page that gracefully guides users back to safety and continues the Archject experience. The page should convey empathy for the missing resource, offer clear navigation back to home or the user’s dashboard (depending on authentication state), and provide a quick search utility to locate projects or decisions. It must align with Archject’s visual language, accessibility standards, and responsive design.

## Page Description (Full Detail)
What this page is:
- A dedicated 404 Not Found page presented when a user attempts to access a non-existent route or resource within the Archject platform.

Goals:
- Soften the friction of broken links by providing a friendly explanation, helpful actions, and quick recovery paths.
- Increase user retention by immediately offering navigation to Home/Landing or Dashboard, plus a quick search to locate relevant projects or decisions.
- Maintain consistent branding, typography, spacing, and UI patterns with the rest of Archject’s product.

Connected features (no deep integrations required for this page):
- Authentication state awareness to determine whether to route to Home/Landing or to the user’s Dashboard.
- Global header/navigation consistency (top bar, user profile actions) to ensure seamless feel when the user lands on this page.
- Search capability (local UI component) to quickly locate projects or decisions within the app.

UI elements and visual guidance:
- Illustration & Message: A friendly, brand-consistent illustration that communicates “not found” (e.g., a dashed path, magnifying glass, or decision-tree motif). A concise, empathetic headline and a short supporting paragraph explaining the resource isn’t found.
- Primary CTA: A prominent call-to-action that directs users to the appropriate destination:
  - If user is authenticated: Go to Dashboard.
  - If user is not authenticated: Go to Home/Landing.
- Secondary CTAs: 
  - Search the catalog or decision logs (inline search bar or quick search widget).
  - Return to previous page (Back button).
- Visual guidance: Maintain a clean, card-like layout centered on the viewport with generous whitespace, consistent with 8px spacing increments. Use soft shadows and rounded corners per the design system.
- Accessibility: All controls must be keyboard accessible with visible focus states. Provide aria-labels and screen-reader friendly text.

## Components to Build
1) 404 Page Shell
- Container: Full-width, responsive center-aligned column layout.
- Card: White card with subtle shadow, 12-16px radius, padding 24-32px.
- Illustration: SVG/illustration component aligned center above copy.
- Copy Block: 
  - Title: Large, bold heading (e.g., “That page isn’t here” or “We couldn’t find that page”).
  - Subtitle: Short explanatory blurb.
- Actions Row:
  - Primary Button: “Go to Dashboard” or “Go to Home” depending on auth state.
  - Secondary Button: “Search” (opens inline search or focuses the search field).
  - Tertiary: “Back” to previous page (uses history.back()).
- Inline Search: Optional compact search field for quick lookup; includes an icon and placeholder “Search projects, decisions, or files…”.

2) Inline Search Component (reusable)
- Input: Rounded field with subtle background (#F5F6FA), placeholder, and clear focus ring.
- Icon: Magnifying glass at left.
- Suggestions/Results: Optional dropdown panel showing quick matches (title + type tag).
- Keyboard handling: Enter to navigate to selected result, arrow keys to traverse.

3) Illustration Pack (Icon Set & Illustration Pack)
- Set of cohesive icons:
  - Not Found icon (e.g., broken link or compass).
  - Home icon, Dashboard icon.
  - Magnifying glass, document, folder, clock (for time-related notes).
  - External link or help icon as optional secondary support.
- Small illustrations for empty states (optional decorative variants for 404 context).
- Styling: Brand-consistent stroke width, fill colors aligned with the palette, scalable SVGs (viewBox-based).
- Export formats: SVGs (for inline use) and PNG/SVG variants for marketing collateral.

## Implementation Requirements

### Frontend
- Page Route:
  - Route: /404 or catch-all route for non-matched paths in a React/Vue/Svelte-like SPA.
  - Fallback rendering that uses a centralized 404 component.
- UI Components:
  - 404Page component as the primary export.
  - Illustration component(s) and inline Search component built to be reusable across the app.
  - Card, Button, Icon, and Input components should already exist in the design system; reuse them with appropriate props.
- State Handling:
  - Detect authentication state (isAuthenticated) from global auth store/context to decide CTA label/destination.
- Routing:
  - On CTA click, navigate to /dashboard if authenticated or / (home/landing) if not.
  - Implement a Back button that uses window.history.back() with a fallback to Home if history is not available.
- Accessibility:
  - All actionable elements are focusable with visible focus ring.
  - Use semantic HTML: main landmark, heading hierarchy, button semantics.
- Responsiveness:
  - Centered layout on all viewports, with fluid sizing. Ensure the card and illustration scale gracefully on mobile.

### Backend
- No external APIs required for this page.
- If the app uses SSR or pre-rendered 404 handling, ensure the page renders correctly with dynamic auth state injection and that no sensitive data is leaked.

### Integration
- The 404Page must integrate with:
  - Global header/navigation so the user perceives consistent chrome.
  - Global styling system (variables for colors, typography, spacing) to ensure consistency.
  - Auth context/provider to determine the correct primary CTA.

## User Experience Flow
1) User browses to a non-existent route.
2) 404 page is rendered with:
   - Brand illustration and a friendly message.
   - Primary CTA that targets the appropriate destination (Dashboard if authenticated, Home if not).
   - Inline search for quick lookup of projects or decisions.
   - Secondary actions: Back to previous page.
3) User can:
   - Click Go to Dashboard/Home to navigate away.
   - Use the Search input to locate items; select a result to navigate.
   - Click Back to return to the previous page or site section.
4) Page remains responsive and accessible, maintaining a calm, professional aesthetic.

## Technical Specifications

Data Models:
- There are no new data models required for the 404 page itself. If your system uses a global UI state for auth, ensure:
  - User object contains isAuthenticated boolean.
  - Routes rely on existing session/auth utilities.

API Endpoints:
- None required for this task. If a centralized analytics/telemetry layer exists, you may log 404 events (optional).

Security:
- No special authentication changes; ensure primary CTA respects existing auth state to avoid exposing restricted routes.

Validation:
- Button actions must navigate correctly; search input must not submit empty queries. No user input expected beyond search.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The 404 page renders with brand-consistent colors, typography, and spacing per the design system.
- [ ] The primary CTA label and destination reflect authentication state (Dashboard for authenticated users; Home for unauthenticated users).
- [ ] The page includes a friendly illustration and a concise explanatory message.
- [ ] An accessible inline search component is present and focuses on user interaction; can locate and navigate to items (mock results ok for this task).
- [ ] Back button correctly returns to the previous page or falls back to Home if history is unavailable.
- [ ] All interactive controls have keyboard accessibility and visible focus states.
- [ ] Visuals adhere to the specified color palette, typography, and card-based layout with 8px spacing increments.

UI/UX Guidelines
Apply the project's design system:
- Follow the provided color palette and typography.
- Use card-based layout with generous white space and soft shadows.
- Implement pill-shaped primary CTAs, subtle hover effects, and accessible focus rings.
- Maintain mobile-first responsiveness with large tap targets.
- Ensure consistency with Archject’s header, navigation patterns, and branding elements.
- Prioritize clarity, calmness, and a trustworthy, professional feel.

- Card: White card with subtle shadow, 12-16px radius, padding 24-32px.
- Illustration: SVG/illustration component aligned center above copy.
- Copy Block: 
  - Title: Large, bold heading (e.g., “That page isn’t here” or “We couldn’t find that page”).
  - Subtitle: Short explanatory blurb.
- Actions Row:
  - Primary Button: “Go to Dashboard” or “Go to Home” depending on auth state.
  - Secondary Button: “Search” (opens inline search or focuses the search field).
  - Tertiary: “Back” to previous page (uses history.back()).
- Inline Search: Optional compact search field for quick lookup; includes an icon and placeholder “Search projects, decisions, or files…”.

2) Inline Search Component (reusable)
- Input: Rounded field with subtle background (#F5F6FA), placeholder, and clear focus ring.

3) Illustration Pack (Icon Set & Illustration Pack)
- Set of cohesive icons:
  - Not Found icon (e.g., broken link or compass).
  - Home icon, Dashboard icon.
  - Magnifying glass, document, folder, clock (for time-related notes).
  - External link or help icon as optional secondary support.
- Small illustrations for empty states (optional decorative variants for 404 context).
- Styling: Brand-consistent stroke width, fill colors aligned with the palette, scalable SVGs (viewBox-based).
- Export formats: SVGs (for inline use) and PNG/SVG variants for marketing collateral.

## Implementation Requirements

### Frontend
- Page Route:
  - Route: /404 or catch-all route for non-matched paths in a React/Vue/Svelte-like SPA.
  - Fallback rendering that uses a centralized 404 component.
- UI Components:
  - 404Page component as the primary export.
  - Illustration component(s) and inline Search component built to be reusable across the app.
  - Card, Button, Icon, and Input components should already exist in the design system; reuse them with appropriate props.
- State Handling:
  - Detect authentication state (isAuthenticated) from global auth store/context to decide CTA label/destination.
- Routing:
  - On CTA click, navigate to /dashboard if authenticated or / (home/landing) if not.
  - Implement a Back button that uses window.history.back() with a fallback to Home if history is not available.
- Accessibility:
  - All actionable elements are focusable with visible focus ring.
  - Use semantic HTML: main landmark, heading hierarchy, button semantics.
- Responsiveness:
  - Centered layout on all viewports, with fluid sizing. Ensure the card and illustration scale gracefully on mobile.

### Backend
- No external APIs required for this page.
- If the app uses SSR or pre-rendered 404 handling, ensure the page renders correctly with dynamic auth state injection and that no sensitive data is leaked.

### Integration
- The 404Page must integrate with:
  - Global header/navigation so the user perceives consistent chrome.
  - Global styling system (variables for colors, typography, spacing) to ensure consistency.
  - Auth context/provider to determine the correct primary CTA.

## User Experience Flow
1) User browses to a non-existent route.
2) 404 page is rendered with:
   - Brand illustration and a friendly message.
   - Primary CTA that targets the appropriate destination (Dashboard if authenticated, Home if not).
   - Inline search for quick lookup of projects or decisions.
   - Secondary actions: Back to previous page.
3) User can:
   - Click Go to Dashboard/Home to navigate away.
   - Use the Search input to locate items; select a result to navigate.
   - Click Back to return to the previous page or site section.
4) Page remains responsive and accessible, maintaining a calm, professional aesthetic.

## Technical Specifications

Data Models:
- There are no new data models required for the 404 page itself. If your system uses a global UI state for auth, ensure:
  - User object contains isAuthenticated boolean.
  - Routes rely on existing session/auth utilities.

API Endpoints:
- None required for this task. If a centralized analytics/telemetry layer exists, you may log 404 events (optional).

Security:
- No special authentication changes; ensure primary CTA respects existing auth state to avoid exposing restricted routes.

Validation:
- Button actions must navigate correctly; search input must not submit empty queries. No user input expected beyond search.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The 404 page renders with brand-consistent colors, typography, and spacing per the design system.
- [ ] The primary CTA label and destination reflect authentication state (Dashboard for authenticated users; Home for unauthenticated users).
- [ ] The page includes a friendly illustration and a concise explanatory message.
- [ ] An accessible inline search component is present and focuses on user interaction; can locate and navigate to items (mock results ok for this task).
- [ ] Back button correctly returns to the previous page or falls back to Home if history is unavailable.
- [ ] All interactive controls have keyboard accessibility and visible focus states.
- [ ] Visuals adhere to the specified color palette, typography, and card-based layout with 8px spacing increments.
