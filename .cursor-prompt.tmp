⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION RULES - READ FIRST ⚠️
❌ NEVER run: npm run dev, npm start, yarn dev, pnpm dev, or ANY development server
❌ NEVER run: long-running processes, servers, or commands that don't exit
❌ NEVER test the application by starting it
✅ ALLOWED: npm install, npm run build, npm run test (if needed)
✅ YOUR TASK: Create/modify files only, then STOP and EXIT immediately
⚠️ The MCP server handles all testing and validation separately

# Modern Design Best Practices

## Philosophy

Create unique, memorable experiences while maintaining consistency through modern design principles. Every project should feel distinct yet professional, innovative yet intuitive.

---

## Landing Pages & Marketing Sites

### Hero Sections
**Go beyond static backgrounds:**
- Animated gradients with subtle movement
- Particle systems or geometric shapes floating
- Interactive canvas backgrounds (Three.js, WebGL)
- Video backgrounds with proper fallbacks
- Parallax scrolling effects
- Gradient mesh animations
- Morphing blob animations


### Layout Patterns
**Use modern grid systems:**
- Bento grids (asymmetric card layouts)
- Masonry layouts for varied content
- Feature sections with diagonal cuts or curves
- Overlapping elements with proper z-index
- Split-screen designs with scroll-triggered reveals

**Avoid:** Traditional 3-column equal grids

### Scroll Animations
**Engage users as they scroll:**
- Fade-in and slide-up animations for sections
- Scroll-triggered parallax effects
- Progress indicators for long pages
- Sticky elements that transform on scroll
- Horizontal scroll sections for portfolios
- Text reveal animations (word by word, letter by letter)
- Number counters animating into view

**Avoid:** Static pages with no scroll interaction

### Call-to-Action Areas
**Make CTAs impossible to miss:**
- Gradient buttons with hover effects
- Floating action buttons with micro-interactions
- Animated borders or glowing effects
- Scale/lift on hover
- Interactive elements that respond to mouse position
- Pulsing indicators for primary actions

---

## Dashboard Applications

### Layout Structure
**Always use collapsible side navigation:**
- Sidebar that can collapse to icons only
- Smooth transition animations between states
- Persistent navigation state (remember user preference)
- Mobile: drawer that slides in/out
- Desktop: sidebar with expand/collapse toggle
- Icons visible even when collapsed

**Structure:**
```
/dashboard (layout wrapper with sidebar)
  /dashboard/overview
  /dashboard/analytics
  /dashboard/settings
  /dashboard/users
  /dashboard/projects
```

All dashboard pages should be nested inside the dashboard layout, not separate routes.

### Data Tables
**Modern table design:**
- Sticky headers on scroll
- Row hover states with subtle elevation
- Sortable columns with clear indicators
- Pagination with items-per-page control
- Search/filter with instant feedback
- Selection checkboxes with bulk actions
- Responsive: cards on mobile, table on desktop
- Loading skeletons, not spinners
- Empty states with illustrations or helpful text

**Use modern table libraries:**
- TanStack Table (React Table v8)
- AG Grid for complex data
- Data Grid from MUI (if using MUI)

### Charts & Visualizations
**Use the latest charting libraries:**
- Recharts (for React, simple charts)
- Chart.js v4 (versatile, well-maintained)
- Apache ECharts (advanced, interactive)
- D3.js (custom, complex visualizations)
- Tremor (for dashboards, built on Recharts)

**Chart best practices:**
- Animated transitions when data changes
- Interactive tooltips with detailed info
- Responsive sizing
- Color scheme matching design system
- Legend placement that doesn't obstruct data
- Loading states while fetching data

### Dashboard Cards
**Metric cards should stand out:**
- Gradient backgrounds or colored accents
- Trend indicators (↑ ↓ with color coding)
- Sparkline charts for historical data
- Hover effects revealing more detail
- Icon representing the metric
- Comparison to previous period

---

## Color & Visual Design

### Color Palettes
**Create depth with gradients:**
- Primary gradient (not just solid primary color)
- Subtle background gradients
- Gradient text for headings
- Gradient borders on cards
- Elevated surfaces for depth

**Color usage:**
- 60-30-10 rule (dominant, secondary, accent)
- Consistent semantic colors (success, warning, error)
- Accessible contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum)

### Typography
**Create hierarchy through contrast:**
- Large, bold headings (48-72px for heroes)
- Clear size differences between levels
- Variable font weights (300, 400, 600, 700)
- Letter spacing for small caps
- Line height 1.5-1.7 for body text
- Inter, Poppins, or DM Sans for modern feel

### Shadows & Depth
**Layer UI elements:**
- Multi-layer shadows for realistic depth
- Colored shadows matching element color
- Elevated states on hover
- Neumorphism for special elements (sparingly)

---

## Interactions & Micro-animations

### Button Interactions
**Every button should react:**
- Scale slightly on hover (1.02-1.05)
- Lift with shadow on hover
- Ripple effect on click
- Loading state with spinner or progress
- Disabled state clearly visible
- Success state with checkmark animation

### Card Interactions
**Make cards feel alive:**
- Lift on hover with increased shadow
- Subtle border glow on hover
- Tilt effect following mouse (3D transform)
- Smooth transitions (200-300ms)
- Click feedback for interactive cards

### Form Interactions
**Guide users through forms:**
- Input focus states with border color change
- Floating labels that animate up
- Real-time validation with inline messages
- Success checkmarks for valid inputs
- Error states with shake animation
- Password strength indicators
- Character count for text areas

### Page Transitions
**Smooth between views:**
- Fade + slide for page changes
- Skeleton loaders during data fetch
- Optimistic UI updates
- Stagger animations for lists
- Route transition animations

---

## Mobile Responsiveness

### Mobile-First Approach
**Design for mobile, enhance for desktop:**
- Touch targets minimum 44x44px
- Generous padding and spacing
- Sticky bottom navigation on mobile
- Collapsible sections for long content
- Swipeable cards and galleries
- Pull-to-refresh where appropriate

### Responsive Patterns
**Adapt layouts intelligently:**
- Hamburger menu → full nav bar
- Card grid → stack on mobile
- Sidebar → drawer
- Multi-column → single column
- Data tables → card list
- Hide/show elements based on viewport

---

## Loading & Empty States

### Loading States
**Never leave users wondering:**
- Skeleton screens matching content layout
- Progress bars for known durations
- Animated placeholders
- Spinners only for short waits (<3s)
- Stagger loading for multiple elements
- Shimmer effects on skeletons

### Empty States
**Make empty states helpful:**
- Illustrations or icons
- Helpful copy explaining why it's empty
- Clear CTA to add first item
- Examples or suggestions
- No "no data" text alone

---

## Unique Elements to Stand Out

### Distinctive Features
**Add personality:**
- Custom cursor effects on landing pages
- Animated page numbers or section indicators
- Unusual hover effects (magnification, distortion)
- Custom scrollbars
- Glassmorphism for overlays
- Animated SVG icons

 for bestpractices and # Decisions List / Content Browser

## Overview
Create the canonical, project-wide Decisions List / Content Browser for Archject that presents every decision in a clear, organized, and actionable way. The page supports robust filters, bulk actions (share links, export, change status), quick previews, and seamless integration with the surrounding decision workflow (CRUD, templates, and dashboards). It should be visually consistent with the project’s design system, accessible, mobile-friendly, and scalable to handle large project ecosystems with multiple decisions, documents, and comments.

## Page Description (Full Detail)
What this page is:
- A central, canonical list of all decisions across a project, presented as a searchable, filterable, and bulk-action-enabled content browser. Each decision is a self-contained object with metadata, options, status, due dates, associated files, comments, and client-facing share links.

Goals:
- Provide fast, full-text search and faceted filters across projects, decisions, files, and comments.
- Enable bulk actions: share client links, export decision data (PDF/CSV/JSON), and bulk status changes (e.g., move multiple decisions from draft to pending or approved).
- Offer quick preview: hover or select a decision to view essential details (summary, options, status, due date, linked files, client link, recent activity) without navigating away.
- Promote faster decision creation via templates and an integrated Create button that leverages the Decision Templates Library.
- Maintain an audit-friendly, time-stamped history and linkage to the Edit / Manage Decision Page for deep editing and versioning.

Connected features:
- Search & Filter Functionality: Full-text search across decisions, projects, files, and comments; faceted filters by status, assignee, date ranges, template type, priority, requester/client status, and tags.
- Decision Objects CRUD: Create, read, update, delete Decision Objects, including options, metadata, and status transitions (draft, pending, approved, rejected). Include per-decision history, change tracking, and versioning hooks for re-issues.
- Decision Templates Library: Library of opinionated templates for common decision types (finishes, layouts, change requests) to accelerate decision creation with pre-filled options, metadata fields, and default status transitions.

UI elements and how they need to look:
- Filter Bar: status (tags), assignee, date range, template type, search box with autosuggest; quick filters for “My Decisions,” “Awaiting Client,” and “Overdue.”
- Decisions Table/Card: per-row or per-card representation showing title, status badge, due date, linked files count, client share link icon, last updated timestamp, and quick action row (edit, duplicate, delete, share).
- Bulk Actions Bar: appears when one or more items are selected; options include Export, Share Links, Change Status, Assign, Remove, and Delete (with confirm).
- Preview Pane: floating or docked pane that shows a quick view of the selected decision with sections for Summary, Key Options, Metadata, Activity, and a link to Open in Manage/Edit page.
- Create Decision Button: prominent, pill-shaped primary action, opening a modal or side panel to create a decision (with metadata, options, and initial status).
- Templates Quick Insert: a panel or dropdown to apply templates during create or via the editor.
- Client Share Links: indicator/icon per decision with copy/share actions and link status (active/expired).

Visual guidance:
- Use the project’s design system: clean white cards, soft shadows, 12–16px radii, ample whitespace, and gentle color accents for statuses. Primary actions use deep green (#195C4A). Success indicators use bright green (#7BE495). Warnings use yellow/orange tones; errors use light red. All typography adheres to the standardized font family and weights.

Connected Pages:
- Dashboard: User-specific overview with decisions awaiting client response and quick actions to create or share client links.
- Edit / Manage Decision Page: Detailed editing with history, version comparison, and reissue share link capability.

API integrations:
- No external APIs required for this task; all data interactions will be via the project’s internal API surface.

## Components to Build
- DecisionsListContainer: Grid/list wrapper for responsive rendering, handles pagination, virtualized scrolling for large datasets.
- FilterBar: UI for text search, multi-selects, range pickers, and quick filters; emits filter state to parent.
- DecisionsTable/Card: Card-based or tabular representation with responsive columns; includes status badge, due date, counts, and action icons.
- PreviewPane: Read-only quick view or interactive mini-editor for summary and metadata; supports hover/selection triggers.
- BulkActionsBar: Top/side bar that enables bulk operations; includes confirm dialogs for destructive actions.
- CreateDecisionModal / CreateDecisionPanel: Form-based creation surface with validation, supports templates integration.
- EditDecisionPageLink: Route or button to navigate to the dedicated Edit / Manage Decision Page.
- TemplatesLibraryPanel: Browse and apply templates; supports searching, filtering, and “Apply template” action.
- ShareLinkManager: UI and logic to generate, copy, and manage client-facing share links (active/expired).
- HistoryPanel: Lightweight view of decision history within the Edit page; for the list view, show last activity snippet.

Technical details for components:
- Each component should be designed with accessibility (A11y) in mind: proper roles, keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, and screen-reader friendly labels.
- State management: Use a centralized store (Redux/Context) or a modern hook-based approach with a clear schema for decisions, templates, filters, and UI state (loading, error, success).

## Implementation Requirements

### Frontend
- Build responsive UI following the design system:
  - Desktop: Two-column layout with a left filter panel and right content area, plus a persistent preview pane.
  - Tablet/Mobile: Collapsible filter bar, card/list list with full-width rows, bottom sheet or modal for create/edit.
- Components should be reusable across the app:
  - Button, Tag/Status, Card, TableRow, Modal, Drawer/Panel, Input, Select, MultiSelect, DateRangePicker, IconButton.
- Interactions:
  - Debounced full-text search; apply filters with a single-click or “Enter” for search.
  - Bulk selection via checkbox in each row; “Select All” in paginated view.
  - Sortable columns in table view and equivalent options in card view (by last updated, due date, status, title).
  - Quick preview on hover or selection; optional pinned preview pane for focus.
- Templates integration:
  - When creating a decision, user can pick a template type (finishes, layouts, change requests) and pre-fill fields.
- Data visualization placeholders:
  - If charts or trend indicators exist on the page (e.g., decisions over time), provide minimal, consistent chart components or placeholders aligned with the design system.

### Backend
- API surface (internal to Archject; ensure endpoints are RESTful or GraphQL-based per project standards):
  - GET /projects/{projectId}/decisions: list with filtering, search, pagination, sorting.
  - POST /projects/{projectId}/decisions: create decision; supports initial options, metadata, status.
  - GET /projects/{projectId}/decisions/{decisionId}: fetch single for quick preview.
  - PATCH /projects/{projectId}/decisions/{decisionId}: update fields, options, metadata, status transitions.
  - DELETE /projects/{projectId}/decisions/{decisionId}: delete decision.
  - POST /projects/{projectId}/decisions/bulk/export: export selected decisions to PDF/CSV/JSON.
  - POST /projects/{projectId}/decisions/bulk/share: generate share links for selected decisions.
  - POST /projects/{projectId}/decisions/bulk/change-status: bulk status update.
  - GET /decision-templates: list templates; GET /decision-templates/{templateId}: details.
  - POST /projects/{projectId}/decisions/{decisionId}/clone: duplicate decision.
- Database tables (conceptual):
  - decisions: id, project_id, title, status (draft/pending/approved/rejected), due_date, assignee_id, template_id, summary, metadata JSON, options JSON, shared_link JSON, created_at, updated_at.
  - decision_options: id, decision_id, option_key, option_value, metadata JSON.
  - decision_history: id, decision_id, action, changed_by, changed_at, diff JSON.
  - decision_files: id, decision_id, file_id, relation_type (attachment, drawing, spec).
  - templates: id, type (finishes/layouts/change_request), name, description, default_options JSON, metadata JSON.
  - share_links: id, decision_id, url, expires_at, status (active/expired).
  - comments: id, decision_id, user_id, content, created_at, updated_at.
- Validation:
  - Business rules for status transitions (e.g., draft -> pending -> approved/rejected; cannot move from approved to draft without explicit action).
  - Metadata and options schema validation per decision type/template.
  - Ensure foreign keys and referential integrity for related entities (files, comments, history).
  - Input validation on create/update: required fields (title, status at minimum), length constraints, and proper date formats.

### Integration
- State synchronization:
  - The DecisionsList page must reflect real-time or near real-time changes from other editors (use WebSocket or long-polling where available; fallback to periodic polling).
- Cross-page consistency:
  - Creating/editing a decision should immediately reflect in the list and update the preview pane.
  - Templates library must sync with Create decision flow and persist chosen templates to the decision record.
- Access control:
  - Ensure users can view decisions for projects they have access to; enforce permissions on CRUD, bulk actions, and sharing.

## User Experience Flow
1. User lands on Decisions List / Content Browser for a project.
2. Page loads with a canonical list of decisions, showing key fields (title, status badge, due date, files count, last updated, and client link status).
3. User uses the Filter Bar:
   - Types a search query; selects one or more statuses; filters by assignee; chooses a date range; optionally filters by template type.
   - Results update in real-time; the user can sort by title, due date, last updated.
4. User selects one or more decisions via checkboxes:
   - Bulk Actions Bar becomes active (Export, Share Links, Change Status, Assign, Delete).
   - User can export to PDF/CSV/JSON or generate share links for all selected decisions.
   - User can bulk-change status (e.g., draft -> pending) with confirmation.
5. User clicks on a decision (or hovers to see a quick preview):
   - Preview Pane displays decision summary, key options, metadata, and recent activity.
   - User can click to “Open in Edit / Manage Decision Page” for full editing; from there, changes are versioned and history is available.
6. User uses Create Decision:
   - Click Create Decision; a modal/side panel opens.
   - User fills in title, selects a template type (finishes/layout/change_request) to prefill fields, adds options and metadata, assigns to a teammate, sets initial status.
   - Upon save, decision appears in the list, and a share link may be generated.
7. User navigates to Templates Library:
   - Browse templates, preview, and apply to a new decision or as a starting point for an existing one.
8. Both the Dashboard and Edit / Manage Decision Page interoperate:
   - Dashboard shows “Decisions awaiting client response” and “Recent activity”; actions from the list surface here.
   - Edit page provides deeper editing with history, version comparison, and reissue share link.

=== TASK ===
# Decisions List / Content Browser

## Overview
Create the canonical, project-wide Decisions List / Content Browser for Archject that presents every decision in a clear, organized, and actionable way. The page supports robust filters, bulk actions (share links, export, change status), quick previews, and seamless integration with the surrounding decision workflow (CRUD, templates, and dashboards). It should be visually consistent with the project’s design system, accessible, mobile-friendly, and scalable to handle large project ecosystems with multiple decisions, documents, and comments.

## Page Description (Full Detail)
What this page is:
- A central, canonical list of all decisions across a project, presented as a searchable, filterable, and bulk-action-enabled content browser. Each decision is a self-contained object with metadata, options, status, due dates, associated files, comments, and client-facing share links.

Goals:
- Provide fast, full-text search and faceted filters across projects, decisions, files, and comments.
- Enable bulk actions: share client links, export decision data (PDF/CSV/JSON), and bulk status changes (e.g., move multiple decisions from draft to pending or approved).
- Offer quick preview: hover or select a decision to view essential details (summary, options, status, due date, linked files, client link, recent activity) without navigating away.
- Promote faster decision creation via templates and an integrated Create button that leverages the Decision Templates Library.
- Maintain an audit-friendly, time-stamped history and linkage to the Edit / Manage Decision Page for deep editing and versioning.

Connected features:
- Search & Filter Functionality: Full-text search across decisions, projects, files, and comments; faceted filters by status, assignee, date ranges, template type, priority, requester/client status, and tags.
- Decision Objects CRUD: Create, read, update, delete Decision Objects, including options, metadata, and status transitions (draft, pending, approved, rejected). Include per-decision history, change tracking, and versioning hooks for re-issues.
- Decision Templates Library: Library of opinionated templates for common decision types (finishes, layouts, change requests) to accelerate decision creation with pre-filled options, metadata fields, and default status transitions.

UI elements and how they need to look:
- Filter Bar: status (tags), assignee, date range, template type, search box with autosuggest; quick filters for “My Decisions,” “Awaiting Client,” and “Overdue.”
- Decisions Table/Card: per-row or per-card representation showing title, status badge, due date, linked files count, client share link icon, last updated timestamp, and quick action row (edit, duplicate, delete, share).
- Bulk Actions Bar: appears when one or more items are selected; options include Export, Share Links, Change Status, Assign, Remove, and Delete (with confirm).
- Preview Pane: floating or docked pane that shows a quick view of the selected decision with sections for Summary, Key Options, Metadata, Activity, and a link to Open in Manage/Edit page.
- Create Decision Button: prominent, pill-shaped primary action, opening a modal or side panel to create a decision (with metadata, options, and initial status).
- Templates Quick Insert: a panel or dropdown to apply templates during create or via the editor.
- Client Share Links: indicator/icon per decision with copy/share actions and link status (active/expired).

Visual guidance:
- Use the project’s design system: clean white cards, soft shadows, 12–16px radii, ample whitespace, and gentle color accents for statuses. Primary actions use deep green (#195C4A). Success indicators use bright green (#7BE495). Warnings use yellow/orange tones; errors use light red. All typography adheres to the standardized font family and weights.

Connected Pages:
- Dashboard: User-specific overview with decisions awaiting client response and quick actions to create or share client links.
- Edit / Manage Decision Page: Detailed editing with history, version comparison, and reissue share link capability.

API integrations:
- No external APIs required for this task; all data interactions will be via the project’s internal API surface.

## Components to Build
- DecisionsListContainer: Grid/list wrapper for responsive rendering, handles pagination, virtualized scrolling for large datasets.
- FilterBar: UI for text search, multi-selects, range pickers, and quick filters; emits filter state to parent.
- DecisionsTable/Card: Card-based or tabular representation with responsive columns; includes status badge, due date, counts, and action icons.
- PreviewPane: Read-only quick view or interactive mini-editor for summary and metadata; supports hover/selection triggers.
- BulkActionsBar: Top/side bar that enables bulk operations; includes confirm dialogs for destructive actions.
- CreateDecisionModal / CreateDecisionPanel: Form-based creation surface with validation, supports templates integration.
- EditDecisionPageLink: Route or button to navigate to the dedicated Edit / Manage Decision Page.
- TemplatesLibraryPanel: Browse and apply templates; supports searching, filtering, and “Apply template” action.
- ShareLinkManager: UI and logic to generate, copy, and manage client-facing share links (active/expired).
- HistoryPanel: Lightweight view of decision history within the Edit page; for the list view, show last activity snippet.

Technical details for components:
- Each component should be designed with accessibility (A11y) in mind: proper roles, keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, and screen-reader friendly labels.
- State management: Use a centralized store (Redux/Context) or a modern hook-based approach with a clear schema for decisions, templates, filters, and UI state (loading, error, success).

## Implementation Requirements

### Frontend
- Build responsive UI following the design system:
  - Desktop: Two-column layout with a left filter panel and right content area, plus a persistent preview pane.
  - Tablet/Mobile: Collapsible filter bar, card/list list with full-width rows, bottom sheet or modal for create/edit.
- Components should be reusable across the app:
  - Button, Tag/Status, Card, TableRow, Modal, Drawer/Panel, Input, Select, MultiSelect, DateRangePicker, IconButton.
- Interactions:
  - Debounced full-text search; apply filters with a single-click or “Enter” for search.
  - Bulk selection via checkbox in each row; “Select All” in paginated view.
  - Sortable columns in table view and equivalent options in card view (by last updated, due date, status, title).
  - Quick preview on hover or selection; optional pinned preview pane for focus.
- Templates integration:
  - When creating a decision, user can pick a template type (finishes, layouts, change requests) and pre-fill fields.
- Data visualization placeholders:
  - If charts or trend indicators exist on the page (e.g., decisions over time), provide minimal, consistent chart components or placeholders aligned with the design system.

### Backend
- API surface (internal to Archject; ensure endpoints are RESTful or GraphQL-based per project standards):
  - GET /projects/{projectId}/decisions: list with filtering, search, pagination, sorting.
  - POST /projects/{projectId}/decisions: create decision; supports initial options, metadata, status.
  - GET /projects/{projectId}/decisions/{decisionId}: fetch single for quick preview.
  - PATCH /projects/{projectId}/decisions/{decisionId}: update fields, options, metadata, status transitions.
  - DELETE /projects/{projectId}/decisions/{decisionId}: delete decision.
  - POST /projects/{projectId}/decisions/bulk/export: export selected decisions to PDF/CSV/JSON.
  - POST /projects/{projectId}/decisions/bulk/share: generate share links for selected decisions.
  - POST /projects/{projectId}/decisions/bulk/change-status: bulk status update.
  - GET /decision-templates: list templates; GET /decision-templates/{templateId}: details.
  - POST /projects/{projectId}/decisions/{decisionId}/clone: duplicate decision.
- Database tables (conceptual):
  - decisions: id, project_id, title, status (draft/pending/approved/rejected), due_date, assignee_id, template_id, summary, metadata JSON, options JSON, shared_link JSON, created_at, updated_at.
  - decision_options: id, decision_id, option_key, option_value, metadata JSON.
  - decision_history: id, decision_id, action, changed_by, changed_at, diff JSON.
  - decision_files: id, decision_id, file_id, relation_type (attachment, drawing, spec).
  - templates: id, type (finishes/layouts/change_request), name, description, default_options JSON, metadata JSON.
  - share_links: id, decision_id, url, expires_at, status (active/expired).
  - comments: id, decision_id, user_id, content, created_at, updated_at.
- Validation:
  - Business rules for status transitions (e.g., draft -> pending -> approved/rejected; cannot move from approved to draft without explicit action).
  - Metadata and options schema validation per decision type/template.
  - Ensure foreign keys and referential integrity for related entities (files, comments, history).
  - Input validation on create/update: required fields (title, status at minimum), length constraints, and proper date formats.

### Integration
- State synchronization:
  - The DecisionsList page must reflect real-time or near real-time changes from other editors (use WebSocket or long-polling where available; fallback to periodic polling).
- Cross-page consistency:
  - Creating/editing a decision should immediately reflect in the list and update the preview pane.
  - Templates library must sync with Create decision flow and persist chosen templates to the decision record.
- Access control:
  - Ensure users can view decisions for projects they have access to; enforce permissions on CRUD, bulk actions, and sharing.

## User Experience Flow
1. User lands on Decisions List / Content Browser for a project.
2. Page loads with a canonical list of decisions, showing key fields (title, status badge, due date, files count, last updated, and client link status).
3. User uses the Filter Bar:
   - Types a search query; selects one or more statuses; filters by assignee; chooses a date range; optionally filters by template type.
   - Results update in real-time; the user can sort by title, due date, last updated.
4. User selects one or more decisions via checkboxes:
   - Bulk Actions Bar becomes active (Export, Share Links, Change Status, Assign, Delete).
   - User can export to PDF/CSV/JSON or generate share links for all selected decisions.
   - User can bulk-change status (e.g., draft -> pending) with confirmation.
5. User clicks on a decision (or hovers to see a quick preview):
   - Preview Pane displays decision summary, key options, metadata, and recent activity.
   - User can click to “Open in Edit / Manage Decision Page” for full editing; from there, changes are versioned and history is available.
6. User uses Create Decision:
   - Click Create Decision; a modal/side panel opens.
   - User fills in title, selects a template type (finishes/layout/change_request) to prefill fields, adds options and metadata, assigns to a teammate, sets initial status.
   - Upon save, decision appears in the list, and a share link may be generated.
7. User navigates to Templates Library:
   - Browse templates, preview, and apply to a new decision or as a starting point for an existing one.
8. Both the Dashboard and Edit / Manage Decision Page interoperate:
   - Dashboard shows “Decisions awaiting client response” and “Recent activity”; actions from the list surface here.
   - Edit page provides deeper editing with history, version comparison, and reissue share link.
