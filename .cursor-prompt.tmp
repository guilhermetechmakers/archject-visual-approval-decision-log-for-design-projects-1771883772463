# Project-Specific Customizations

**IMPORTANT: This section contains the specific design requirements for THIS project. The guidelines above are universal best practices - these customizations below take precedence for project-specific decisions.**

## User Design Requirements

Client Portal and Internal Decision Detail.
  - Card-based, grid layouts, accessible components, responsive behavior (mobile-first).
  - Inline media annotation tools with zoom/pan, scrubber for media timeline (if applicable).
  - Rich text input with mention suggestions, emoji support optional.

---

## Implementation Requirements

### Frontend
- Build a cohesive design system-aligned UI:
  - Reusable React/Vue/Svelte components (Card, Button, Input, Tag, Tabs, MediaViewer, AnnotationOverlay, CommentThread).
  - MediaAnnotationOverlay component capable of rendering shapes, showing metadata, and allowing edits by authorized users.
  - CommentThread component with nested replies, edit/delete windows, mention highlighting, and inline actions (edit, delete, resolve).
  - Side-by-side OptionComparison component: responsive grid that adapts to viewport; shows media, specs, cost, and decision notes per option.
  - Real-time update indicators (typing, new comments, annotation changes).

- Pages:
  - Client Portal (No-login Link):
    - Route: /client-portal/:decisionToken
    - Features: authentication via token, side-by-side comparison, comment composer with mentions, annotation-capable media, approve/change-request actions, optional OTP flow.
  - Decision Detail (Internal):
    - Route: /internal/decisions/:decisionId
    - Features: full decision data, option-by-option annotations, audit trail, export controls, moderation tools, admin actions.

- Accessibility:
  - ARIA roles, keyboard navigable, proper focus management, readable contrast (WCAG 2.1 AA).

- Internationalization:
  - Prepare for i18n (text keys, date/number localization) if needed.

- Performance:
  - Lazy loading of options/media, pagination for comments, efficient annotation rendering for large media.
  - Debounced input for comment typing, optimistic UI updates.

- Mobile-first considerations:
  - Stacked layout with collapsible sections, touch-friendly controls, and large tap targets.

- Testing:
  - Unit tests for models and services, integration tests for end-to-end comment flow, WebSocket events, and export generation.

### Backend
- Data Models (SQL/NoSQL as appropriate):
  - User: id, name, email, role, preferences.
  - Project: id, name, branding tokens, default settings.
  - Decision: id, project_id, title, status (pending/approved/revoked/needs_changes), created_at, updated_at, approved_by, approved_at, revoked_at.
  - Option: id, decision_id, title, description, media_ids, specs, price, comparison_rank.
  - Media: id, asset_url, type (image/pdf/3d), media_metadata, linked_annotations (array of annotation_ids).
  - Annotation: id, media_id, option_id (nullable), shape_type (point/rect/polygon), coordinates (JSON), created_by, created_at, updated_by, updated_at, note.
  - Comment: id, decision_id, option_id (nullable), parent_id (nullable for threading), author_id, text, mentions (array of user_ids), created_at, updated_at, edited_by, edited_at, status (active/edited/deleted).
  - Notification: id, user_id, type (mention/comment/approval), reference_id, read_at, created_at.
  - ApprovalHistory: id, decision_id, user_id, action (created/approved/rejected/edited), timestamp, details (JSON).
  - Export: id, decision_id, type (pdf/json/csv), generated_at, url.

- APIs (REST or GraphQL):
  - Decisions
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}
    - POST /api/decisions
    - PUT /api/decisions/{id}
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/approve
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/revoke
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}/export
  - Options
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}/options
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/options
  - Media-Annotations
    - POST /api/media/{media_id}/annotations
    - PUT /api/annotations/{id}
    - DELETE /api/annotations/{id}
    - GET /api/media/{media_id}/annotations
  - Comments
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}/comments
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/comments
    - PUT /api/comments/{id}
    - DELETE /api/comments/{id}
  - Mentions & Notifications
    - POST /api/notifications/mention
    - GET /api/notifications?user_id=...
  - Real-time
    - WebSocket channel endpoints for /ws/decisions/{decisionId}
  - Exports
    - GET /api/exports/{export_id}
  - Auth
    - OAuth2 / JWT-based authentication; token validation; role checks.

- Database indexing and constraints:
  - Index on decision_id for comments, annotations; index on media_id; composite indexes for option and decision lookups.
  - Foreign keys: decision -> project; option -> decision; annotation -> media/option; comment -> decision/option/parent; notification -> user.

- Real-time & Messaging:
  - WebSocket channels per decision for comments and annotation updates.
  - Fallback to long-polling if WebSockets unavailable.
  - Debounce rapid comment streams; ensure at-least-once delivery semantics.

- Security:
  - No-login access tokens for client portal with expiration; token rotation.
  - Server-side validation for all inputs; server-side enforcement of business rules (e.g., cannot approve after revoke).
  - Rate limiting on comment POSTs and OTP validation; detect and mitigate abuse.

- Data Integrity & Auditing:
  - Immutable audit entries for approvals and edits; versioning for comments and annotations (with delta diffs if feasible).
  - Export exports reproduce exact state snapshots with timestamps.

### Integration
- Client Portal and Internal Decision Detail both consume the same backend APIs:
  - Shared data models for decisions, options, media, comments, and annotations.
  - Client Portal uses a token-based access path with read/write scoped permissions; Limited comment actions, no admin controls.
  - Internal view uses full permissions (create/edit/delete, export, revoke).

- Branding & Theming:
  - Centralized design tokens for colors, font sizes, spacing, radii.
  - Components should adapt to the brand’s palette and be override-ready for client-specific branding.

- Error Handling:
  - Consistent error payload structure; user-friendly messages; telemetry hooks for errors.

---

## User Experience Flow

1) Client Portal (No-login Link)
- Client opens a shareable link to a decision with side-by-side options.
- Client views media and option details; annotations are visible and can be added by authorized clients if permitted.
- Client adds a comment, optionally mentioning internal team members. Comment appears in real-time or near real-time.
- Client annotates media coordinates to indicate preferences or concerns (where allowed).
- Client can approve or request changes, optionally leaving a short note; action triggers a notification to internal stakeholders.
- If OTP/verification is enabled:
  - Client enters email (if captured) or phone to receive an OTP.
  - Client enters OTP to validate before submitting approval or comments beyond a basic level.
- Notifications: when a new comment or mention appears, the client gets a notification via the chosen channel.

2) Internal Decision Detail (Admin)
- Internal user logs in to /internal/decisions/{decisionId}.
- See the decision overview with status, timestamps, and approval history.
- Open each option to view side-by-side comparisons, related media, and inline annotations.
- View and reply to comments; edit or delete comments within allowed windows; resolve comments if applicable.
- Add annotations to media; modify existing annotations or create new ones; link annotations to specific options if needed.
- Admin actions:
  - Edit decision details, revise option data, or adjust approvals.
  - Revoke approvals with rationale; log revoke reason in ApprovalHistory.
  - Export decision logs to PDF/JSON/CSV; download or share export URL.
- Real-time updates ensure parallel editors see changes instantly.

3) Notifications & Mentions
- Mentions trigger in-app notifications; mention recipients are auto-tagged and alerted.
- Clients and internal users receive notifications about:
  - New comments, replies, or annotations.
  - Status changes (approved, changes requested, revoked).
  - Mentions and upcoming deadlines/reminders.

4) Moderation
- Moderators can edit/delete inappropriate content within allowed windows.
- Moderation logs captured with user and timestamp.

  - MediaAnnotationOverlay component capable of rendering shapes, showing metadata, and allowing edits by authorized users.
  - CommentThread component with nested replies, edit/delete windows, mention highlighting, and inline actions (edit, delete, resolve).
  - Side-by-side OptionComparison component: responsive grid that adapts to viewport; shows media, specs, cost, and decision notes per option.
  - Real-time update indicators (typing, new comments, annotation changes).

- Pages:
  - Client Portal (No-login Link):
    - Route: /client-portal/:decisionToken
    - Features: authentication via token, side-by-side comparison, comment composer with mentions, annotation-capable media, approve/change-request actions, optional OTP flow.
  - Decision Detail (Internal):
    - Route: /internal/decisions/:decisionId
    - Features: full decision data, option-by-option annotations, audit trail, export controls, moderation tools, admin actions.

- Accessibility:
  - ARIA roles, keyboard navigable, proper focus management, readable contrast (WCAG 2.1 AA).

- Internationalization:
  - Prepare for i18n (text keys, date/number localization) if needed.

- Performance:
  - Lazy loading of options/media, pagination for comments, efficient annotation rendering for large media.
  - Debounced input for comment typing, optimistic UI updates.

- Mobile-first considerations:
  - Stacked layout with collapsible sections, touch-friendly controls, and large tap targets.

- Testing:
  - Unit tests for models and services, integration tests for end-to-end comment flow, WebSocket events, and export generation.

### Backend
- Data Models (SQL/NoSQL as appropriate):
  - User: id, name, email, role, preferences.
  - Project: id, name, branding tokens, default settings.
  - Decision: id, project_id, title, status (pending/approved/revoked/needs_changes), created_at, updated_at, approved_by, approved_at, revoked_at.
  - Option: id, decision_id, title, description, media_ids, specs, price, comparison_rank.
  - Media: id, asset_url, type (image/pdf/3d), media_metadata, linked_annotations (array of annotation_ids).
  - Annotation: id, media_id, option_id (nullable), shape_type (point/rect/polygon), coordinates (JSON), created_by, created_at, updated_by, updated_at, note.
  - Comment: id, decision_id, option_id (nullable), parent_id (nullable for threading), author_id, text, mentions (array of user_ids), created_at, updated_at, edited_by, edited_at, status (active/edited/deleted).

  - Mentions & Notifications
    - POST /api/notifications/mention
    - GET /api/notifications?user_id=...
  - Real-time
    - WebSocket channel endpoints for /ws/decisions/{decisionId}
  - Exports
    - GET /api/exports/{export_id}
  - Auth
    - OAuth2 / JWT-based authentication; token validation; role checks.

- Database indexing and constraints:
  - Index on decision_id for comments, annotations; index on media_id; composite indexes for option and decision lookups.
  - Foreign keys: decision -> project; option -> decision; annotation -> media/option; comment -> decision/option/parent; notification -> user.

- Real-time & Messaging:
  - WebSocket channels per decision for comments and annotation updates.
  - Fallback to long-polling if WebSockets unavailable.
  - Debounce rapid comment streams; ensure at-least-once delivery semantics.

- Security:
  - No-login access tokens for client portal with expiration; token rotation.
  - Server-side validation for all inputs; server-side enforcement of business rules (e.g., cannot approve after revoke).
  - Rate limiting on comment POSTs and OTP validation; detect and mitigate abuse.

- Data Integrity & Auditing:
  - Immutable audit entries for approvals and edits; versioning for comments and annotations (with delta diffs if feasible).
  - Export exports reproduce exact state snapshots with timestamps.

### Integration
- Client Portal and Internal Decision Detail both consume the same backend APIs:
  - Shared data models for decisions, options, media, comments, and annotations.
  - Client Portal uses a token-based access path with read/write scoped permissions; Limited comment actions, no admin controls.
  - Internal view uses full permissions (create/edit/delete, export, revoke).

- Branding & Theming:
  - Centralized design tokens for colors, font sizes, spacing, radii.
  - Components should adapt to the brand’s palette and be override-ready for client-specific branding.

- Error Handling:
  - Consistent error payload structure; user-friendly messages; telemetry hooks for errors.

---

## User Experience Flow

1) Client Portal (No-login Link)
- Client opens a shareable link to a decision with side-by-side options.
- Client views media and option details; annotations are visible and can be added by authorized clients if permitted.
- Client adds a comment, optionally mentioning internal team members. Comment appears in real-time or near real-time.
- Client annotates media coordinates to indicate preferences or concerns (where allowed).
- Client can approve or request changes, optionally leaving a short note; action triggers a notification to internal stakeholders.
- If OTP/verification is enabled:
  - Client enters email (if captured) or phone to receive an OTP.
  - Client enters OTP to validate before submitting approval or comments beyond a basic level.
- Notifications: when a new comment or mention appears, the client gets a notification via the chosen channel.

2) Internal Decision Detail (Admin)
- Internal user logs in to /internal/decisions/{decisionId}.
- See the decision overview with status, timestamps, and approval history.
- Open each option to view side-by-side comparisons, related media, and inline annotations.
- View and reply to comments; edit or delete comments within allowed windows; resolve comments if applicable.
- Add annotations to media; modify existing annotations or create new ones; link annotations to specific options if needed.
- Admin actions:
  - Edit decision details, revise option data, or adjust approvals.
  - Revoke approvals with rationale; log revoke reason in ApprovalHistory.
  - Export decision logs to PDF/JSON/CSV; download or share export URL.
- Real-time updates ensure parallel editors see changes instantly.

3) Notifications & Mentions
- Mentions trigger in-app notifications; mention recipients are auto-tagged and alerted.
- Clients and internal users receive notifications about:
  - New comments, replies, or annotations.
  - Status changes (approved, changes requested, revoked).
  - Mentions and upcoming deadlines/reminders.

4) Moderation
- Moderators can edit/delete inappropriate content within allowed windows.
- Moderation logs captured with user and timestamp.

 for bestpractices and # Payment & Billing

## Overview
Build a production-ready Payment & Billing subsystem for Archject that enables subscription management, billing, invoices, and add-on purchases via Stripe. The system will support seat-based or usage-based billing, proration, webhooks for real-time events, and an admin UI for managing invoices, refunds, and plan changes. The feature set includes a secure checkout flow, an order/history view with downloadable receipts, and a subscription management page with payment method updates and plan upgrades/downgrades. All billing data must be stored securely with Stripe as the source of truth for payment data. No raw card data should be stored on our servers; leverage Stripe Elements / Payment Intents and Stripe Customer objects. Provide a polished, accessible, mobile-first UI aligned to the project’s design system.

=== TASK ===
# Payment & Billing

## Overview
Build a production-ready Payment & Billing subsystem for Archject that enables subscription management, billing, invoices, and add-on purchases via Stripe. The system will support seat-based or usage-based billing, proration, webhooks for real-time events, and an admin UI for managing invoices, refunds, and plan changes. The feature set includes a secure checkout flow, an order/history view with downloadable receipts, and a subscription management page with payment method updates and plan upgrades/downgrades. All billing data must be stored securely with Stripe as the source of truth for payment data. No raw card data should be stored on our servers; leverage Stripe Elements / Payment Intents and Stripe Customer objects. Provide a polished, accessible, mobile-first UI aligned to the project’s design system.

## Implementation Requirements

### Frontend
- Pages and components
  - Checkout Page: flow with pricing summary, coupon, promo codes, payment method entry via Stripe Elements, shipping not applicable.
  - Transaction / Order History: filters (date, status, plan, add-ons), search, export, and receipt download.
  - Billing / Subscription Page: current plan, billing history, payment method management, upgrade/downgrade controls, usage meters.
  - Shared components: Card, Button (primary: green #195C4A, secondary: soft fills), Tabs/navigation, Status Chips (green/yellow/red), Input fields with focus states, Dropdowns, Table with sortable columns, Modal dialogs, toasts/notifications.

- UI/UX specifics
  - Adhere to the design system colors, typography, spacing, and card styles described in the Visual Style section.
  - Cards with 24px min padding, 12–16px radius, elevation shadows, hover states.
  - Top navigation with pill-shaped tabs; active state uses deep green #195C4A and white text.
  - Data visualization placeholders for usage trends (optional) using safe color accents (blue/green/red) to indicate deltas.

- Accessibility
  - Conforming to WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines.
  - All interactive elements keyboard-navigable, with aria-labels and screen-reader-friendly phrasing.
  - Color contrast checks for text and important UI elements.

### Backend
- APIs and services
  - Stripe Customer and Subscription management service:
    - Create customer on first payment method capture; attach payment method; create subscription with proration settings.
    - Handle add-ons as line items; support metered usage with Stripe usage records.
  - Invoice Service:
    - Retrieve, generate, and store invoice data; provide secure invoice download URLs or PDFs.
  - Payment Intent Service:
    - Create and confirm payment intents, handle 3D Secure or SCA flows as needed.
  - Webhook Handler:
    - Validate Stripe webhook signatures.
    - Update local records on events: invoice.paid, invoice.payment_failed, subscription.updated/downgrade/upgrade, invoice.upcoming, invoice.payment_succeeded, payment_intent.succeeded, payment_intent.payment_failed, charge.refunded.
  - Admin Billing Operations:
    - Refunds, invoice adjustments, line item edits with proper audit trails.
  - Data Models:
    - User: id, stripe_customer_id, default_payment_method_id, subscription_id, billing_address, tax_exempt flag, metered_billing_enabled.
    - Plan: id, stripe_price_id, name, description, price, interval, features, proration_behavior.
    - AddOn: id, stripe_price_id, name, price, interval.
    - Subscription: id, user_id, stripe_subscription_id, plan_id, status, current_period_start, current_period_end, cancel_at_period_end, quantity (seats), addons[], usage_metrics.
    - Invoice: id, stripe_invoice_id, user_id, subscription_id, amount_due, amount_paid, status, period_start, period_end, pdf_url or hosted_invoice_url, created_at, updated_at.
    - UsageRecord: id, subscription_id, timestamp, quantity, meter_id, description.

- Data storage and security
  - Use encrypted fields for sensitive billing metadata if stored (encryption at rest, key management).
  - Do not store full card numbers; store only Stripe references (customer_id, payment_method_id, etc.).
  - Access controls: Admin endpoints for refunds and adjustments; standard user endpoints for their own billing data.

- Validation and reliability
  - Idempotent operations for webhook processing.
  - Consistent synchronization between Stripe and local DB; reconcile on a schedule or upon webhook events.
  - Rate limiting and retry strategies for external Stripe calls.
  - Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages.

### Integration

- Data flow
  - User initiates checkout: frontend collects payment via Stripe Elements → backend creates PaymentIntent → Stripe confirms → on success, create or update Stripe Subscription, create local invoice/record.
  - Add-ons: itemized charges as line items in Stripe invoice or subscription add-ons; ensure synchronization with local records.
  - Usage metering: app sends usage events to Stripe as needed; reflect in invoices via metered billing.
  - Webhooks: Stripe events update local records; trigger user-facing notifications (receipts, payment success/failure, subscription changes).
  - Admin actions: refunds or adjustments propagate to Stripe and update local invoices.

- Data mapping
  - Map Stripe objects to local models: customer -> user, subscription -> subscription, invoice -> invoice, payment_method -> user.payment_methods, plan/add-on prices -> Stripe price IDs.

- Testing
  - End-to-end tests for: successful subscription creation, upgrade/downgrade with proration, add-ons, usage-based billing, refunds, and webhook processing.
  - Mock Stripe with test mode; simulate 3D Secure challenges if applicable.

---

## User Experience Flow

1) User visits Billing area (Billing / Subscription Page)
- Sees current plan, next billing date, next invoice amount, and usage meters.
- Can update payment method; add a new card via Stripe Elements; set as default.

2) User initiates a Checkout for a subscription or add-on (Checkout / Payment Page)
- Selects plan and any add-ons; reviews order summary; enters coupon if available; sees prorated amount if upgrading mid-cycle.
- Proceeds to payment; Stripe Elements collect card details; authentication handled as required (SCA/3DS).
- On success: user is redirected to Transaction History with a success receipt; local subscription updated; next invoice generated.

3) User reviews Transactions / Order History
- Filters by date range, status (paid, pending, failed), plan, or add-ons.
- Clicks an invoice to view details; downloads PDF or Stripe-hosted receipt.

4) Admin workflow (Admin UI)
- Admin views all invoices, issues refunds, adjusts line items, or changes plans with proration details.
- Admin can view audit trails and export decision logs for contracts/records.

5) Webhook-driven events
- Payment succeeds: local invoice marked paid; user receives receipt.
- Payment fails: user notified; potential retry logic displayed.
- Subscription changes: plan upgrades/downgrades applied with prorated charges; UI reflects new plan and upcoming invoice.
