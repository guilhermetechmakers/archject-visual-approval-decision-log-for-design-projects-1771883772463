⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION RULES - READ FIRST ⚠️
❌ NEVER run: npm run dev, npm start, yarn dev, pnpm dev, or ANY development server
❌ NEVER run: long-running processes, servers, or commands that don't exit
❌ NEVER test the application by starting it
✅ ALLOWED: npm install, npm run build, npm run test (if needed)
✅ YOUR TASK: Create/modify files only, then STOP and EXIT immediately
⚠️ The MCP server handles all testing and validation separately

**Go beyond static backgrounds:**
- Animated gradients with subtle movement
- Particle systems or geometric shapes floating
- Interactive canvas backgrounds (Three.js, WebGL)
- Video backgrounds with proper fallbacks
- Parallax scrolling effects
- Gradient mesh animations
- Morphing blob animations


### Layout Patterns
**Use modern grid systems:**
- Bento grids (asymmetric card layouts)
- Masonry layouts for varied content
- Feature sections with diagonal cuts or curves
- Overlapping elements with proper z-index
- Split-screen designs with scroll-triggered reveals

**Avoid:** Traditional 3-column equal grids

### Scroll Animations
**Engage users as they scroll:**
- Fade-in and slide-up animations for sections
- Scroll-triggered parallax effects
- Progress indicators for long pages
- Sticky elements that transform on scroll
- Horizontal scroll sections for portfolios
- Text reveal animations (word by word, letter by letter)

- Animated borders or glowing effects
- Scale/lift on hover
- Interactive elements that respond to mouse position
- Pulsing indicators for primary actions

---

## Dashboard Applications

### Layout Structure
**Always use collapsible side navigation:**
- Sidebar that can collapse to icons only
- Smooth transition animations between states
- Persistent navigation state (remember user preference)
- Mobile: drawer that slides in/out
- Desktop: sidebar with expand/collapse toggle
- Icons visible even when collapsed

**Structure:**
```
/dashboard (layout wrapper with sidebar)
  /dashboard/overview
  /dashboard/analytics
  /dashboard/settings
  /dashboard/users
  /dashboard/projects
```

All dashboard pages should be nested inside the dashboard layout, not separate routes.

### Data Tables
**Modern table design:**
- Sticky headers on scroll
- Row hover states with subtle elevation
- Sortable columns with clear indicators
- Pagination with items-per-page control
- Search/filter with instant feedback

- Skeleton loaders during data fetch
- Optimistic UI updates
- Stagger animations for lists
- Route transition animations

---

## Mobile Responsiveness

### Mobile-First Approach
**Design for mobile, enhance for desktop:**
- Touch targets minimum 44x44px
- Generous padding and spacing
- Sticky bottom navigation on mobile
- Collapsible sections for long content
- Swipeable cards and galleries

 for bestpractices and # Project & Workspace Management

## Overview
Develop a comprehensive Project & Workspace Management system for Archject that enables creation and management of projects/workspaces with branding, templates, and storage quotas. The system should support project-level RBAC with invitation flows, soft-delete/archive semantics, workspace quotas and usage tracking, and a client-facing, no-login decision-approval experience. It must tie into four associated pages: Dashboard, Settings / Preferences, Team & Users, and Project Workspace. The UI should follow the specified visual and interaction guidelines, delivering a modern, minimalist, accessible, and mobile-friendly experience.

## Components to Build
1) Project & Workspace Management Core
- Data model for Project, Workspace, Branding, Templates, and Quotas.
- Create, Read, Update, Soft-delete (archive) and Restore operations.
- Branding fields: logo, color tokens, fonts, banner, project-specific styles.
- Template system: decision templates (options, comments, default workflows).
- Storage quotas: per-workspace and per-project limits, usage tracking (decisions, files, decisions log).
- Invitations: generate and manage project-level invitations; invite clients with roles and scopes.
- RBAC: roles at project/workspace level with permission scopes (view, edit, invite, manage branding, export, archive).
- Audit log: actions with timestamps, actor, and target.

2) Dashboard Page
- User-specific dashboard showing:
  - Active projects/workspaces with status chips and quick counts (decisions awaiting client response, storage usage).
  - Recent activity feed with filters (project, user, date).
  - Quick actions: create a decision, share client link, invite client to project.
  - Global search and quick-create panel.
- Client-facing link generation and copy/share with expiration controls.

3) Settings / Preferences Page
- Account-level and workspace-level settings:
  - Billing: plan, renewal, invoices, payment methods, usage metrics.
  - Branding: global and project-specific branding overrides, upload logos, color tokens.
  - Notification preferences: email, in-app, webhooks.
  - Integrations: connected services (Slack, Microsoft Teams, CAD viewers, file storage).
  - API keys management: create, rotate, revoke keys, scopes.
  - Data export: export workspace data, decisions, templates, audit logs; data residency options if applicable.
- Import/Export hooks and data privacy controls.

4) Team & Users Page
- Manage team members and clients:
  - Invite members with role assignments at workspace or project level.
  - Invite clients to projects with time-bound access and limited scopes.
  - Review and modify permission scopes for each member.
  - Directory view with search, status, and activity indicators.
- Access controls and least-privilege enforcement.

5) Project Workspace Page
- Project-level workspace view:
  - Overview panel with branding, status, and project settings.
  - Decisions list: decisions with options, comments, timestamps, and approval status.
  - Project files management and organization (folders, shared links, versioning).
  - Team members per project with roles.
  - Templates section: apply templates to decisions, create new templates.
  - Quick actions to create decisions, add files, or update project branding.
- Client-facing decision review area (no-login link) with side-by-side comparison of options, comments, and final approval.

## Implementation Requirements

### Frontend
- UI Framework: Build with React (or similar) + a component library aligned with the design system.
- Pages and Components:
  - Dashboard: Cards for projects, activity feed, quick actions, and search bar.
  - Project Workspace Page: Project header (branding), decisions table/list, file manager, team panel, templates panel, and overview.
  - Settings / Preferences: Tabs or collapsible sections for Billing, Branding, Notifications, Integrations, API Keys, Data Export.

- UI Components:
  - Card components with the specified shadows, borders, padding, and hover states.
  - Pill-shaped navigation tabs with active state in #195C4A.
  - Tables with sortable columns and status chips (green/yellow/red).
  - Forms: rounded inputs with focus states, soft backgrounds (#F5F6FA), validation messages.
  - Status tags: rounded, lightly colored backgrounds for status.
  - Data visualization placeholders: charts/graphs with color tokens (primary blue, red for negative).
  - File/Decision viewers: modal panels for details and side-by-side option comparisons.
  - Client-facing link UI: share modal with expiration, copy, and analytics on access.
- Accessibility: ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, color contrast checks, and focus outlines.

# Project & Workspace Management

## Overview
Develop a comprehensive Project & Workspace Management system for Archject that enables creation and management of projects/workspaces with branding, templates, and storage quotas. The system should support project-level RBAC with invitation flows, soft-delete/archive semantics, workspace quotas and usage tracking, and a client-facing, no-login decision-approval experience. It must tie into four associated pages: Dashboard, Settings / Preferences, Team & Users, and Project Workspace. The UI should follow the specified visual and interaction guidelines, delivering a modern, minimalist, accessible, and mobile-friendly experience.

- Branding fields: logo, color tokens, fonts, banner, project-specific styles.
- Template system: decision templates (options, comments, default workflows).
- Storage quotas: per-workspace and per-project limits, usage tracking (decisions, files, decisions log).
- Invitations: generate and manage project-level invitations; invite clients with roles and scopes.
- RBAC: roles at project/workspace level with permission scopes (view, edit, invite, manage branding, export, archive).
- Audit log: actions with timestamps, actor, and target.

2) Dashboard Page
- User-specific dashboard showing:
  - Active projects/workspaces with status chips and quick counts (decisions awaiting client response, storage usage).
  - Recent activity feed with filters (project, user, date).
  - Quick actions: create a decision, share client link, invite client to project.
  - Global search and quick-create panel.

- Access controls and least-privilege enforcement.

5) Project Workspace Page
- Project-level workspace view:
  - Overview panel with branding, status, and project settings.
  - Decisions list: decisions with options, comments, timestamps, and approval status.
  - Project files management and organization (folders, shared links, versioning).
  - Team members per project with roles.
  - Templates section: apply templates to decisions, create new templates.
