# Project-Specific Customizations

**IMPORTANT: This section contains the specific design requirements for THIS project. The guidelines above are universal best practices - these customizations below take precedence for project-specific decisions.**

## User Design Requirements

Client Portal and Internal Decision Detail.
  - Card-based, grid layouts, accessible components, responsive behavior (mobile-first).
  - Inline media annotation tools with zoom/pan, scrubber for media timeline (if applicable).
  - Rich text input with mention suggestions, emoji support optional.

---

## Implementation Requirements

### Frontend
- Build a cohesive design system-aligned UI:
  - Reusable React/Vue/Svelte components (Card, Button, Input, Tag, Tabs, MediaViewer, AnnotationOverlay, CommentThread).
  - MediaAnnotationOverlay component capable of rendering shapes, showing metadata, and allowing edits by authorized users.
  - CommentThread component with nested replies, edit/delete windows, mention highlighting, and inline actions (edit, delete, resolve).
  - Side-by-side OptionComparison component: responsive grid that adapts to viewport; shows media, specs, cost, and decision notes per option.
  - Real-time update indicators (typing, new comments, annotation changes).

- Pages:
  - Client Portal (No-login Link):
    - Route: /client-portal/:decisionToken
    - Features: authentication via token, side-by-side comparison, comment composer with mentions, annotation-capable media, approve/change-request actions, optional OTP flow.
  - Decision Detail (Internal):
    - Route: /internal/decisions/:decisionId
    - Features: full decision data, option-by-option annotations, audit trail, export controls, moderation tools, admin actions.

- Accessibility:
  - ARIA roles, keyboard navigable, proper focus management, readable contrast (WCAG 2.1 AA).

- Internationalization:
  - Prepare for i18n (text keys, date/number localization) if needed.

- Performance:
  - Lazy loading of options/media, pagination for comments, efficient annotation rendering for large media.
  - Debounced input for comment typing, optimistic UI updates.

- Mobile-first considerations:
  - Stacked layout with collapsible sections, touch-friendly controls, and large tap targets.

- Testing:
  - Unit tests for models and services, integration tests for end-to-end comment flow, WebSocket events, and export generation.

### Backend
- Data Models (SQL/NoSQL as appropriate):
  - User: id, name, email, role, preferences.
  - Project: id, name, branding tokens, default settings.
  - Decision: id, project_id, title, status (pending/approved/revoked/needs_changes), created_at, updated_at, approved_by, approved_at, revoked_at.
  - Option: id, decision_id, title, description, media_ids, specs, price, comparison_rank.
  - Media: id, asset_url, type (image/pdf/3d), media_metadata, linked_annotations (array of annotation_ids).
  - Annotation: id, media_id, option_id (nullable), shape_type (point/rect/polygon), coordinates (JSON), created_by, created_at, updated_by, updated_at, note.
  - Comment: id, decision_id, option_id (nullable), parent_id (nullable for threading), author_id, text, mentions (array of user_ids), created_at, updated_at, edited_by, edited_at, status (active/edited/deleted).
  - Notification: id, user_id, type (mention/comment/approval), reference_id, read_at, created_at.
  - ApprovalHistory: id, decision_id, user_id, action (created/approved/rejected/edited), timestamp, details (JSON).
  - Export: id, decision_id, type (pdf/json/csv), generated_at, url.

- APIs (REST or GraphQL):
  - Decisions
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}
    - POST /api/decisions
    - PUT /api/decisions/{id}
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/approve
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/revoke
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}/export
  - Options
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}/options
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/options
  - Media-Annotations
    - POST /api/media/{media_id}/annotations
    - PUT /api/annotations/{id}
    - DELETE /api/annotations/{id}
    - GET /api/media/{media_id}/annotations
  - Comments
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}/comments
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/comments
    - PUT /api/comments/{id}
    - DELETE /api/comments/{id}
  - Mentions & Notifications
    - POST /api/notifications/mention
    - GET /api/notifications?user_id=...
  - Real-time
    - WebSocket channel endpoints for /ws/decisions/{decisionId}
  - Exports
    - GET /api/exports/{export_id}
  - Auth
    - OAuth2 / JWT-based authentication; token validation; role checks.

- Database indexing and constraints:
  - Index on decision_id for comments, annotations; index on media_id; composite indexes for option and decision lookups.
  - Foreign keys: decision -> project; option -> decision; annotation -> media/option; comment -> decision/option/parent; notification -> user.

- Real-time & Messaging:
  - WebSocket channels per decision for comments and annotation updates.
  - Fallback to long-polling if WebSockets unavailable.
  - Debounce rapid comment streams; ensure at-least-once delivery semantics.

- Security:
  - No-login access tokens for client portal with expiration; token rotation.
  - Server-side validation for all inputs; server-side enforcement of business rules (e.g., cannot approve after revoke).
  - Rate limiting on comment POSTs and OTP validation; detect and mitigate abuse.

- Data Integrity & Auditing:
  - Immutable audit entries for approvals and edits; versioning for comments and annotations (with delta diffs if feasible).
  - Export exports reproduce exact state snapshots with timestamps.

### Integration
- Client Portal and Internal Decision Detail both consume the same backend APIs:
  - Shared data models for decisions, options, media, comments, and annotations.
  - Client Portal uses a token-based access path with read/write scoped permissions; Limited comment actions, no admin controls.
  - Internal view uses full permissions (create/edit/delete, export, revoke).

- Branding & Theming:
  - Centralized design tokens for colors, font sizes, spacing, radii.
  - Components should adapt to the brand’s palette and be override-ready for client-specific branding.

- Error Handling:
  - Consistent error payload structure; user-friendly messages; telemetry hooks for errors.

---

## User Experience Flow

1) Client Portal (No-login Link)
- Client opens a shareable link to a decision with side-by-side options.
- Client views media and option details; annotations are visible and can be added by authorized clients if permitted.
- Client adds a comment, optionally mentioning internal team members. Comment appears in real-time or near real-time.
- Client annotates media coordinates to indicate preferences or concerns (where allowed).
- Client can approve or request changes, optionally leaving a short note; action triggers a notification to internal stakeholders.
- If OTP/verification is enabled:
  - Client enters email (if captured) or phone to receive an OTP.
  - Client enters OTP to validate before submitting approval or comments beyond a basic level.
- Notifications: when a new comment or mention appears, the client gets a notification via the chosen channel.

2) Internal Decision Detail (Admin)
- Internal user logs in to /internal/decisions/{decisionId}.
- See the decision overview with status, timestamps, and approval history.
- Open each option to view side-by-side comparisons, related media, and inline annotations.
- View and reply to comments; edit or delete comments within allowed windows; resolve comments if applicable.
- Add annotations to media; modify existing annotations or create new ones; link annotations to specific options if needed.
- Admin actions:
  - Edit decision details, revise option data, or adjust approvals.
  - Revoke approvals with rationale; log revoke reason in ApprovalHistory.
  - Export decision logs to PDF/JSON/CSV; download or share export URL.
- Real-time updates ensure parallel editors see changes instantly.

3) Notifications & Mentions
- Mentions trigger in-app notifications; mention recipients are auto-tagged and alerted.
- Clients and internal users receive notifications about:
  - New comments, replies, or annotations.
  - Status changes (approved, changes requested, revoked).
  - Mentions and upcoming deadlines/reminders.

4) Moderation
- Moderators can edit/delete inappropriate content within allowed windows.
- Moderation logs captured with user and timestamp.

**Never leave users wondering:**
- Skeleton screens matching content layout
- Progress bars for known durations
- Animated placeholders
- Spinners only for short waits (<3s)
- Stagger loading for multiple elements
- Shimmer effects on skeletons

### Empty States
**Make empty states helpful:**
- Illustrations or icons
- Helpful copy explaining why it's empty
- Clear CTA to add first item
- Examples or suggestions
- No "no data" text alone

## Unique Elements to Stand Out

### Distinctive Features
**Add personality:**
- Custom cursor effects on landing pages
- Animated page numbers or section indicators
- Unusual hover effects (magnification, distortion)
- Custom scrollbars
- Glassmorphism for overlays
- Animated SVG icons
- Typewriter effects for hero text
- Confetti or celebration animations for actions

### Interactive Elements

- Border radius values
- Animation timing (200ms, 300ms, 500ms)
- Color system (primary, secondary, accent, neutrals)
- Typography scale
- Icon style (outline vs filled)
- Button styles across the app
- Form element styles

### What Can Vary
**Project-specific customization:**
- Color palette (different colors, same system)
- Layout creativity (grids, asymmetry)
- Illustration style
- Animation personality
- Feature-specific interactions
- Hero section design
- Card styling variations
- Background patterns or textures

# Project-Specific Customizations

**IMPORTANT: This section contains the specific design requirements for THIS project. The guidelines above are universal best practices - these customizations below take precedence for project-specific decisions.**

## User Design Requirements

Client Portal and Internal Decision Detail.
  - Card-based, grid layouts, accessible components, responsive behavior (mobile-first).
  - Inline media annotation tools with zoom/pan, scrubber for media timeline (if applicable).
  - Rich text input with mention suggestions, emoji support optional.

---

## Implementation Requirements

### Frontend
- Build a cohesive design system-aligned UI:
  - Reusable React/Vue/Svelte components (Card, Button, Input, Tag, Tabs, MediaViewer, AnnotationOverlay, CommentThread).
  - MediaAnnotationOverlay component capable of rendering shapes, showing metadata, and allowing edits by authorized users.
  - CommentThread component with nested replies, edit/delete windows, mention highlighting, and inline actions (edit, delete, resolve).
  - Side-by-side OptionComparison component: responsive grid that adapts to viewport; shows media, specs, cost, and decision notes per option.
  - Real-time update indicators (typing, new comments, annotation changes).

- Pages:
  - Client Portal (No-login Link):
    - Route: /client-portal/:decisionToken
    - Features: authentication via token, side-by-side comparison, comment composer with mentions, annotation-capable media, approve/change-request actions, optional OTP flow.
  - Decision Detail (Internal):
    - Route: /internal/decisions/:decisionId
    - Features: full decision data, option-by-option annotations, audit trail, export controls, moderation tools, admin actions.

- Accessibility:
  - ARIA roles, keyboard navigable, proper focus management, readable contrast (WCAG 2.1 AA).

- Internationalization:
  - Prepare for i18n (text keys, date/number localization) if needed.

- Performance:
  - Lazy loading of options/media, pagination for comments, efficient annotation rendering for large media.
  - Debounced input for comment typing, optimistic UI updates.

- Mobile-first considerations:
  - Stacked layout with collapsible sections, touch-friendly controls, and large tap targets.

- Testing:
  - Unit tests for models and services, integration tests for end-to-end comment flow, WebSocket events, and export generation.

### Backend
- Data Models (SQL/NoSQL as appropriate):
  - User: id, name, email, role, preferences.
  - Project: id, name, branding tokens, default settings.
  - Decision: id, project_id, title, status (pending/approved/revoked/needs_changes), created_at, updated_at, approved_by, approved_at, revoked_at.
  - Option: id, decision_id, title, description, media_ids, specs, price, comparison_rank.
  - Media: id, asset_url, type (image/pdf/3d), media_metadata, linked_annotations (array of annotation_ids).
  - Annotation: id, media_id, option_id (nullable), shape_type (point/rect/polygon), coordinates (JSON), created_by, created_at, updated_by, updated_at, note.
  - Comment: id, decision_id, option_id (nullable), parent_id (nullable for threading), author_id, text, mentions (array of user_ids), created_at, updated_at, edited_by, edited_at, status (active/edited/deleted).
  - Notification: id, user_id, type (mention/comment/approval), reference_id, read_at, created_at.
  - ApprovalHistory: id, decision_id, user_id, action (created/approved/rejected/edited), timestamp, details (JSON).
  - Export: id, decision_id, type (pdf/json/csv), generated_at, url.

- APIs (REST or GraphQL):

  - Mentions & Notifications
    - POST /api/notifications/mention
    - GET /api/notifications?user_id=...
  - Real-time
    - WebSocket channel endpoints for /ws/decisions/{decisionId}
  - Exports
    - GET /api/exports/{export_id}
  - Auth
    - OAuth2 / JWT-based authentication; token validation; role checks.

- Database indexing and constraints:
  - Index on decision_id for comments, annotations; index on media_id; composite indexes for option and decision lookups.
  - Foreign keys: decision -> project; option -> decision; annotation -> media/option; comment -> decision/option/parent; notification -> user.

- Real-time & Messaging:
  - WebSocket channels per decision for comments and annotation updates.
  - Fallback to long-polling if WebSockets unavailable.
  - Debounce rapid comment streams; ensure at-least-once delivery semantics.

- Security:
  - No-login access tokens for client portal with expiration; token rotation.
  - Server-side validation for all inputs; server-side enforcement of business rules (e.g., cannot approve after revoke).
  - Rate limiting on comment POSTs and OTP validation; detect and mitigate abuse.

- Data Integrity & Auditing:
  - Immutable audit entries for approvals and edits; versioning for comments and annotations (with delta diffs if feasible).
  - Export exports reproduce exact state snapshots with timestamps.

### Integration
- Client Portal and Internal Decision Detail both consume the same backend APIs:
  - Shared data models for decisions, options, media, comments, and annotations.
  - Client Portal uses a token-based access path with read/write scoped permissions; Limited comment actions, no admin controls.
  - Internal view uses full permissions (create/edit/delete, export, revoke).

- Branding & Theming:
  - Centralized design tokens for colors, font sizes, spacing, radii.
  - Components should adapt to the brand’s palette and be override-ready for client-specific branding.

- Error Handling:
  - Consistent error payload structure; user-friendly messages; telemetry hooks for errors.

---

## User Experience Flow

1) Client Portal (No-login Link)
- Client opens a shareable link to a decision with side-by-side options.
- Client views media and option details; annotations are visible and can be added by authorized clients if permitted.
- Client adds a comment, optionally mentioning internal team members. Comment appears in real-time or near real-time.
- Client annotates media coordinates to indicate preferences or concerns (where allowed).
- Client can approve or request changes, optionally leaving a short note; action triggers a notification to internal stakeholders.
- If OTP/verification is enabled:
  - Client enters email (if captured) or phone to receive an OTP.
  - Client enters OTP to validate before submitting approval or comments beyond a basic level.
- Notifications: when a new comment or mention appears, the client gets a notification via the chosen channel.

2) Internal Decision Detail (Admin)
- Internal user logs in to /internal/decisions/{decisionId}.
- See the decision overview with status, timestamps, and approval history.
- Open each option to view side-by-side comparisons, related media, and inline annotations.
- View and reply to comments; edit or delete comments within allowed windows; resolve comments if applicable.
- Add annotations to media; modify existing annotations or create new ones; link annotations to specific options if needed.
- Admin actions:
  - Edit decision details, revise option data, or adjust approvals.
  - Revoke approvals with rationale; log revoke reason in ApprovalHistory.
  - Export decision logs to PDF/JSON/CSV; download or share export URL.
- Real-time updates ensure parallel editors see changes instantly.

3) Notifications & Mentions
- Mentions trigger in-app notifications; mention recipients are auto-tagged and alerted.
- Clients and internal users receive notifications about:
  - New comments, replies, or annotations.
  - Status changes (approved, changes requested, revoked).
  - Mentions and upcoming deadlines/reminders.

4) Moderation
- Moderators can edit/delete inappropriate content within allowed windows.
- Moderation logs captured with user and timestamp.

 for bestpractices and # Workspace Branding & Custom Links

## Overview
Develop a cohesive set of features and pages to support Workspace Branding & Custom Links for studios using Archject. This includes visual branding (logo, accent colors), a customizable domain/prefix for client-facing links, and a lightweight client portal (no-login link) with side-by-side option reviews, comments, and approvals/changes. Additionally, implement Settings / Preferences (branding, billing, integrations, API keys, data export) and a Project Workspace Page that aggregates decisions, files, team, templates, and project overview with branding applied. All branding assets must be stored in cloud storage (S3/Cloudinary), support preview/validation, and propagate to client-rendered views. Enterprise needs TLS-provisioned custom domains/CNAME support. Ensure strong security, robust validation, and a smooth UX with a modern, minimal, and accessible design language.

## Components to Build
1. Branding Engine
   - Upload and store branding assets (logo SVG/PNG, color tokens, font choices, accent colors).
   - Validate branding inputs (contrast checks, size limits, responsive logo sizing).
   - Propagate branding tokens to all client-facing renderings (client portal, no-login link, and project pages).
   - Preview mode with live WYSIWYG for branding changes.
   - Domain/URL customization: support custom domain or URL prefix for client links; store CNAME/DNS metadata; enforce TLS/ACME provisioning workflow (Let’s Encrypt or managed TLS).

2. Client Portal (No-login Link)
   - Lightweight, branded no-login client portal page.
   - Side-by-side comparison UI for options (decisions), with ability to add inline comments.
   - Approve or request changes for each decision; accumulate a project-wide approval state.
   - Optional email capture with OTP verification for client authentication.
   - Secure link generation with expiring tokens and domain-bound branding.
   - Full audit trail of comments, decisions, approvals, and time stamps.
   - Offline/print-friendly view export (PDF/print-ready).

3. Settings / Preferences
   - Account-wide and workspace-specific settings.
   - Billing: plan, invoices, payment methods, usage metrics.
   - Branding: upload/logo, color tokens, preview, domain/prefix configuration.
   - Notification preferences: channels (email, in-app, webhooks), event types, cadence.
   - Integrations: external tools (CAD/BIM, cloud storage, messaging), webhooks.
   - API Keys: generation, scoping, rotation, revocation.
   - Data export: export workspace data (Decisions, templates, project data, audit logs) in standard formats (JSON/CSV/PDF).

4. Project Workspace Page
   - Project-level workspace with:
     - Decisions: structured objects with options, comments, timestamps, approvals.
     - Project files: drawings, specs, images; versioning and access controls.
     - Team members: roles, permissions, invitations.
     - Templates: predefined decision templates and approval flows.
     - Project overview: branding applied, status indicators, next actions.
   - Branding applied at project level (logo, color tokens) with per-project overrides if allowed.
   - Activity feed and audit logging.

5. API Layer & Data Persistence
   - Centralized APIs to manage branding, client portal, settings, and project workspace data.
   - Durable data schemas for branding tokens, domain configuration, client portal sessions, decisions, templates, and audit logs.
   - Webhooks and event notifications for branding changes, approvals, and export events.

6. Security & Compliance
   - Authentication/Authorization: role-based access control (RBAC) for workspace admins, project members, clients (via no-login link with token).
   - JWT/OAuth where applicable; short-lived tokens for client portal links.
   - TLS provisioning for custom domains; certificate management and renewal automation.
   - Data residency considerations for export files; encryption at rest/in transit.

7. Integrations & Data Flow
   - Connect branding engine to client portal rendering and project workspace UI.
   - Propagate branding tokens to all front-end components via a centralized theming service or CSS-in-JS tokens.
   - S3/Cloudinary integration for asset storage; URL generation for assets; CDN caching strategy.
   - Optional: AI-ready hooks for branding validation, e.g., contrast checking, logo-sizing recommendations.

- Custom Domain TLS provisioning must be integrated with a certificate automation service (ACME) and DNS management (DNS provider API).
- OTP verification should be optional and configurable per workspace; integrate with existing email service provider (sendGrid/AWS SES) for OTP delivery.
- Data Export must be exportable in multiple formats and include a deterministic schema for external compliance.

## User Experience Flow

1. Branding Setup
   - Admin navigates to Settings / Branding.
   - Uploads a logo (SVG/PNG), selects primary/secondary accent colors, and chooses typography presets.
   - Enters a custom domain or URL prefix for client-facing links (e.g., client.archject.co or projects.archject.co/your-project).
   - Runs branding validation (contrast checks, logo sizing, mobile previews).
   - Enables TLS provisioning; selects certificate method (Let’s Encrypt or managed).
   - Preview mode shows how branding appears on Client Portal, Project Workspace, and No-Login Portal.
   - Save changes; branding tokens propagate to all client-facing views.

2. Client Portal (No-login Link)
   - Admin creates a new client portal link with a projectId via the Portal API.
   - Generate a no-login link (custom domain/prefix included) with a securely signed token and optional expiry.
   - Client receives the link; optionally completes email OTP verification.
   - Client views side-by-side decisions, adds comments, and approves or requests changes.
   - All interactions are timestamped and stored; an audit trail is updated.
   - Admin can view portal usage, review comments, and export decision logs.

3. Settings / Preferences
   - Admin reviews and updates billing, branding, and notification preferences.
   - Configures integrations and API keys (with rotation controls).
   - Initiates workspace data export; tracks progress and downloads results when ready.

4. Project Workspace Page
   - User navigates to a specific project; the page applies workspace branding.
   - See decision log, related files, and team members.
   - Create or edit decisions; apply templates for common approval flows.
   - View project overview, status, and next actions.
   - Access templates and reuse across projects; branding remains consistent.

5. Domain/Branding Management (Enterprise)
   - Admin configures custom domain/CNAME for client links.
   - TLS provisioning is initiated; certificate issuance and renewal are managed automatically.
   - Domain validation and readiness check are displayed in UI.

Security
- Authentication: OAuth 2.0 / JWT with refresh tokens; admin and user roles.
- Authorization: RBAC with roles such as Admin, Brand Manager, Project Lead, Team Member, Client (via no-login link).
- No-login links: time-limited, signed tokens; IP/domain restrictions if enterprise policy requires.
- Data at rest: encryption (AES-256) for sensitive exports; in transit TLS 1.2+.
- Domain/TLS: automated TLS provisioning via ACME; certificate renewal workflow and revocation handling.

Validation
- Branding validation: contrast ratio checks (WCAG AA), minimum logo dimensions, aspect ratio constraints, color token validity, live preview validation.
- Input validation: required fields, length limits, regex for emails, URL formats for domain/prefix, allowed characters for branding keys.
- OTP: rate limiting per session, max attempts, expiry window.
- File uploads: size limits, mime-type checks, SVGO optimization for SVGs, PNG/WebP size constraints.
- API validation: schema validation, request/response contracts, versioning.

Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Branding assets upload stores in S3/Cloudinary with accessible URLs and propagates to client portal and project pages in real time (or near real-time).
- [ ] Custom domain/CNAME provisioning workflow completes with TLS certificates and is reflected in client-facing links; domain status is visible in UI.
- [ ] Client Portal (No-login Link) renders side-by-side option comparisons, supports comments, and allows approve/request changes; OTP verification works when enabled; all actions are auditable.
- [ ] Settings / Preferences allow branding, billing, integrations, API key management, and data export, with export results accessible and correctly formatted.
- [ ] Project Workspace Page shows decisions, files, team, templates, with branding applied consistently; actions (create/edit decisions, templates) are fully functional.

=== TASK ===
# Workspace Branding & Custom Links

## Overview
Develop a cohesive set of features and pages to support Workspace Branding & Custom Links for studios using Archject. This includes visual branding (logo, accent colors), a customizable domain/prefix for client-facing links, and a lightweight client portal (no-login link) with side-by-side option reviews, comments, and approvals/changes. Additionally, implement Settings / Preferences (branding, billing, integrations, API keys, data export) and a Project Workspace Page that aggregates decisions, files, team, templates, and project overview with branding applied. All branding assets must be stored in cloud storage (S3/Cloudinary), support preview/validation, and propagate to client-rendered views. Enterprise needs TLS-provisioned custom domains/CNAME support. Ensure strong security, robust validation, and a smooth UX with a modern, minimal, and accessible design language.

## Components to Build
1. Branding Engine
   - Upload and store branding assets (logo SVG/PNG, color tokens, font choices, accent colors).
   - Validate branding inputs (contrast checks, size limits, responsive logo sizing).
   - Propagate branding tokens to all client-facing renderings (client portal, no-login link, and project pages).
   - Preview mode with live WYSIWYG for branding changes.
   - Domain/URL customization: support custom domain or URL prefix for client links; store CNAME/DNS metadata; enforce TLS/ACME provisioning workflow (Let’s Encrypt or managed TLS).

2. Client Portal (No-login Link)
   - Lightweight, branded no-login client portal page.
   - Side-by-side comparison UI for options (decisions), with ability to add inline comments.
   - Approve or request changes for each decision; accumulate a project-wide approval state.
   - Optional email capture with OTP verification for client authentication.
   - Secure link generation with expiring tokens and domain-bound branding.
   - Full audit trail of comments, decisions, approvals, and time stamps.
   - Offline/print-friendly view export (PDF/print-ready).

3. Settings / Preferences
   - Account-wide and workspace-specific settings.
   - Billing: plan, invoices, payment methods, usage metrics.
   - Branding: upload/logo, color tokens, preview, domain/prefix configuration.
   - Notification preferences: channels (email, in-app, webhooks), event types, cadence.
   - Integrations: external tools (CAD/BIM, cloud storage, messaging), webhooks.
   - API Keys: generation, scoping, rotation, revocation.
   - Data export: export workspace data (Decisions, templates, project data, audit logs) in standard formats (JSON/CSV/PDF).

4. Project Workspace Page
   - Project-level workspace with:
     - Decisions: structured objects with options, comments, timestamps, approvals.
     - Project files: drawings, specs, images; versioning and access controls.
     - Team members: roles, permissions, invitations.
     - Templates: predefined decision templates and approval flows.
     - Project overview: branding applied, status indicators, next actions.
   - Branding applied at project level (logo, color tokens) with per-project overrides if allowed.
   - Activity feed and audit logging.

5. API Layer & Data Persistence
   - Centralized APIs to manage branding, client portal, settings, and project workspace data.
   - Durable data schemas for branding tokens, domain configuration, client portal sessions, decisions, templates, and audit logs.
   - Webhooks and event notifications for branding changes, approvals, and export events.

6. Security & Compliance
   - Authentication/Authorization: role-based access control (RBAC) for workspace admins, project members, clients (via no-login link with token).
   - JWT/OAuth where applicable; short-lived tokens for client portal links.
   - TLS provisioning for custom domains; certificate management and renewal automation.
   - Data residency considerations for export files; encryption at rest/in transit.

7. Integrations & Data Flow
   - Connect branding engine to client portal rendering and project workspace UI.
   - Propagate branding tokens to all front-end components via a centralized theming service or CSS-in-JS tokens.
   - S3/Cloudinary integration for asset storage; URL generation for assets; CDN caching strategy.
   - Optional: AI-ready hooks for branding validation, e.g., contrast checking, logo-sizing recommendations.

## Implementation Requirements

### Frontend
- UI Framework: Use the project’s existing stack (React or similar) with a design system aligned to the provided visual language.
- Pages/Views:
  - Branding Studio: branding assets uploader, color token editor, font/typography picker, live preview, domain/prefix manager, TLS/SSL status, branding validation (contrast, logo size).

  - PreviewPane: renders client-facing pages using current branding tokens.
  - NoLoginPortal: responsive client portal shell with option reviews, comments, and approvals.
  - OTPCapture: email-based verification flow (optional) with rate limiting.
  - ProjectWorkspace: board/list views for decisions, files, and team; project overview card.
  - TemplatesPanel: reusable decision templates.
  - DataExportPanel: triggers and tracks export jobs (CSV/JSON/PDF).
- State Management: centralized theming state (branding tokens) propagated through context/provider; use memoization to avoid re-renders on branding changes.
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA, keyboard navigable, proper ARIA labels, color contrast checks in tooling.

- OTP verification should be optional and configurable per workspace; integrate with existing email service provider (sendGrid/AWS SES) for OTP delivery.
- Data Export must be exportable in multiple formats and include a deterministic schema for external compliance.

## User Experience Flow

1. Branding Setup
   - Admin navigates to Settings / Branding.
   - Uploads a logo (SVG/PNG), selects primary/secondary accent colors, and chooses typography presets.
   - Enters a custom domain or URL prefix for client-facing links (e.g., client.archject.co or projects.archject.co/your-project).
   - Runs branding validation (contrast checks, logo sizing, mobile previews).
   - Enables TLS provisioning; selects certificate method (Let’s Encrypt or managed).
   - Preview mode shows how branding appears on Client Portal, Project Workspace, and No-Login Portal.
   - Save changes; branding tokens propagate to all client-facing views.

2. Client Portal (No-login Link)
   - Admin creates a new client portal link with a projectId via the Portal API.
   - Generate a no-login link (custom domain/prefix included) with a securely signed token and optional expiry.
   - Client receives the link; optionally completes email OTP verification.
   - Client views side-by-side decisions, adds comments, and approves or requests changes.
   - All interactions are timestamped and stored; an audit trail is updated.
   - Admin can view portal usage, review comments, and export decision logs.

3. Settings / Preferences
   - Admin reviews and updates billing, branding, and notification preferences.
   - Configures integrations and API keys (with rotation controls).
   - Initiates workspace data export; tracks progress and downloads results when ready.

4. Project Workspace Page
   - User navigates to a specific project; the page applies workspace branding.
   - See decision log, related files, and team members.
   - Create or edit decisions; apply templates for common approval flows.
   - View project overview, status, and next actions.
   - Access templates and reuse across projects; branding remains consistent.

5. Domain/Branding Management (Enterprise)
   - Admin configures custom domain/CNAME for client links.
   - TLS provisioning is initiated; certificate issuance and renewal are managed automatically.
   - Domain validation and readiness check are displayed in UI.
