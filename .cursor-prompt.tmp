⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION RULES - READ FIRST ⚠️
❌ NEVER run: npm run dev, npm start, yarn dev, pnpm dev, or ANY development server
❌ NEVER run: long-running processes, servers, or commands that don't exit
❌ NEVER test the application by starting it
✅ ALLOWED: npm install, npm run build, npm run test (if needed)
✅ YOUR TASK: Create/modify files only, then STOP and EXIT immediately
⚠️ The MCP server handles all testing and validation separately

# Modern Design Best Practices

## Philosophy

Create unique, memorable experiences while maintaining consistency through modern design principles. Every project should feel distinct yet professional, innovative yet intuitive.

---

## Landing Pages & Marketing Sites

### Hero Sections
**Go beyond static backgrounds:**
- Animated gradients with subtle movement
- Particle systems or geometric shapes floating
- Interactive canvas backgrounds (Three.js, WebGL)
- Video backgrounds with proper fallbacks
- Parallax scrolling effects
- Gradient mesh animations
- Morphing blob animations


### Layout Patterns
**Use modern grid systems:**
- Bento grids (asymmetric card layouts)
- Masonry layouts for varied content
- Feature sections with diagonal cuts or curves
- Overlapping elements with proper z-index
- Split-screen designs with scroll-triggered reveals

**Avoid:** Traditional 3-column equal grids

### Scroll Animations
**Engage users as they scroll:**
- Fade-in and slide-up animations for sections
- Scroll-triggered parallax effects
- Progress indicators for long pages
- Sticky elements that transform on scroll
- Horizontal scroll sections for portfolios
- Text reveal animations (word by word, letter by letter)
- Number counters animating into view

**Avoid:** Static pages with no scroll interaction

### Call-to-Action Areas
**Make CTAs impossible to miss:**
- Gradient buttons with hover effects
- Floating action buttons with micro-interactions
- Animated borders or glowing effects
- Scale/lift on hover
- Interactive elements that respond to mouse position
- Pulsing indicators for primary actions

---

## Dashboard Applications

### Layout Structure
**Always use collapsible side navigation:**
- Sidebar that can collapse to icons only
- Smooth transition animations between states
- Persistent navigation state (remember user preference)
- Mobile: drawer that slides in/out
- Desktop: sidebar with expand/collapse toggle
- Icons visible even when collapsed

**Structure:**
```
/dashboard (layout wrapper with sidebar)
  /dashboard/overview
  /dashboard/analytics
  /dashboard/settings
  /dashboard/users
  /dashboard/projects
```

All dashboard pages should be nested inside the dashboard layout, not separate routes.

### Data Tables
**Modern table design:**
- Sticky headers on scroll
- Row hover states with subtle elevation
- Sortable columns with clear indicators
- Pagination with items-per-page control
- Search/filter with instant feedback
- Selection checkboxes with bulk actions
- Responsive: cards on mobile, table on desktop
- Loading skeletons, not spinners
- Empty states with illustrations or helpful text

**Use modern table libraries:**
- TanStack Table (React Table v8)
- AG Grid for complex data
- Data Grid from MUI (if using MUI)

### Charts & Visualizations
**Use the latest charting libraries:**
- Recharts (for React, simple charts)
- Chart.js v4 (versatile, well-maintained)
- Apache ECharts (advanced, interactive)
- D3.js (custom, complex visualizations)
- Tremor (for dashboards, built on Recharts)

**Chart best practices:**
- Animated transitions when data changes
- Interactive tooltips with detailed info
- Responsive sizing
- Color scheme matching design system
- Legend placement that doesn't obstruct data
- Loading states while fetching data

### Dashboard Cards
**Metric cards should stand out:**
- Gradient backgrounds or colored accents
- Trend indicators (↑ ↓ with color coding)
- Sparkline charts for historical data
- Hover effects revealing more detail
- Icon representing the metric
- Comparison to previous period

---

## Color & Visual Design

### Color Palettes
**Create depth with gradients:**
- Primary gradient (not just solid primary color)
- Subtle background gradients
- Gradient text for headings
- Gradient borders on cards
- Elevated surfaces for depth

**Color usage:**
- 60-30-10 rule (dominant, secondary, accent)

- Accessible contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum)

### Typography
**Create hierarchy through contrast:**
- Large, bold headings (48-72px for heroes)
- Clear size differences between levels
- Variable font weights (300, 400, 600, 700)
- Letter spacing for small caps
- Line height 1.5-1.7 for body text
- Inter, Poppins, or DM Sans for modern feel

### Shadows & Depth
**Layer UI elements:**
- Multi-layer shadows for realistic depth
- Colored shadows matching element color
- Elevated states on hover
- Neumorphism for special elements (sparingly)

---

## Interactions & Micro-animations

### Button Interactions
**Every button should react:**
- Scale slightly on hover (1.02-1.05)

---

## Loading & Empty States

### Loading States
**Never leave users wondering:**
- Skeleton screens matching content layout
- Progress bars for known durations
- Animated placeholders
- Spinners only for short waits (<3s)
- Stagger loading for multiple elements
- Shimmer effects on skeletons

### Empty States
**Make empty states helpful:**
- Illustrations or icons
- Helpful copy explaining why it's empty
- Clear CTA to add first item
- Examples or suggestions
- No "no data" text alone

---

## Unique Elements to Stand Out

### Distinctive Features
**Add personality:**
- Custom cursor effects on landing pages

 for bestpractices and # Admin Dashboard

## Overview
Develop a robust Admin Dashboard for platform administrators to manage accounts, monitor usage and system health, handle moderation tasks, enforce security/compliance controls, and support internal workflows. This admin hub will connect tightly with Admin Tools & Moderation, User Authentication, Session Management, and Security/Privacy/Compliance features, and include a dedicated Admin - User Management page for live intervention, impersonation, and escalations.

## Page Description (Full Detail)
The Admin Dashboard is the central platform admin area designed to give operators visibility into the entire system and direct action capability. Goals:
- Provide a high-level overview of accounts, usage metrics, system health, and ongoing requests.
- Offer Admin Tools & Moderation capabilities to manage users, workspaces, billing exceptions, disputes, and support escalations.
- Ensure secure authentication flows, workspace life cycle management, and token/session lifecycle governance.
- Enforce data governance, retention, audit logging, and enterprise privacy controls with export capabilities.
- Supply a focused UI for Admin - User Management to view and intervene in customer workspaces, impersonate accounts for support, and perform escalations.

Connected features:
- Admin Tools & Moderation: Tools to block/disable accounts, modify workspaces, apply billing exceptions, resolve disputes, escalate support tickets.
- User Authentication: Sign-up/login flows, OAuth integrations, and creation/managing of workspaces tied to accounts.
- Session Management: Issue/refresh/revoke tokens, enforce single-use refresh tokens, monitor active sessions.
- Security, Privacy & Compliance: Data export, retention policies, audit logs, enterprise privacy controls.
- Admin - User Management: View and intervene in customer workspaces, impersonation for support, escalation actions.

UI guidance and expectations:
- High-level dashboards with Accounts Overview, System Health, Support Queue, Usage & Billing, and Feature Toggles.
- Card-based layout with clear hierarchies; tables with sortable columns; charts showing key metrics (uptime, errors, queue length, usage).
- Quick actions: impersonate, escalate, export data, apply policy changes, enable/disable features.
- Visual consistency with the project’s design system: soft shadows, rounded corners, gentle color palette, accessible typography, and responsive behavior.

Note: No external API integrations are mandated by the project context, but the design should be ready to connect to your existing services (auth, user/workspace management, billing, logs, and audit systems) via well-defined REST/GraphQL endpoints.

## Components to Build
- Admin Dashboard Shell
  - Top navigation with pill-shaped tabs; Active state uses deep green (#195C4A).
  - Left-hand secondary navigation (collapsible sections).
  - User profile actions on the right (search, add, profile menu).
- Accounts Overview Card
  - Metrics: total active workspaces, trial signups, plan distribution, churn rate.
  - Visual: compact KPI tiles, small trend charts.
- System Health Panel
  - Uptime, API latency, queue backlogs, recent errors, health statuses.
  - Real-time/near-time data visualization.
- Usage & Requests Panel
  - Traffic, API usage, rate limits, pending requests, support escalations.
- Support Queue Panel
  - Flagged disputes, billing tickets, escalation statuses; action buttons for review, escalate, approve/deny.
- Admin Tools & Moderation Panel
  - User management (suspend/activate, role changes), Workspace management (merge/split, suspend, rename), Billing exceptions (manual adjustments), Disputes resolution, Support escalations routing.
- Admin - User Management Page
  - Workspace list with actions: impersonate, escalate, export, view details.
  - Impersonation workflow modal with safeguards (confirmation, audit log, sandbox mode).
  - Escalation actions and notes, with audit trail.
- Data Export & Compliance Panel
  - Export job queue, policy editor (retention), audit log viewer/search, privacy controls toggles.
- Feature Toggles & Settings
  - Enable/disable enterprise features, rollout controls, environment flags.

Technical details for components:
- Reusable Card components with header/body/actions regions.

### Integration
- Data Flow
  - Admin Dashboard fetches summary data from /admin/dashboard/summary
  - Admin pages call respective endpoints for users, workspaces, disputes, exports
  - Impersonation actions route through a controlled session switch with audit logging
- Data Consistency
  - Maintain referential integrity between accounts, workspaces, and users
  - Propagate status changes across related entities (e.g., suspending a user updates workspace access)
- Event Handling
  - Admin actions emit events to audit/logging systems; optionally publish to a message bus for downstream analytics

## User Experience Flow
1) Admin logs in to /admin/dashboard with elevated privileges.
2) Admin reviews Overview: Accounts, System Health, Support Queue, Usage.
3) Admin navigates to Admin - User Management to view customer workspaces.
4) Admin selects a workspace; views details, initiates impersonation for support if needed.
5) If issues require escalation, Admin opens an escalation for the disputed workspace or billing irregularity.
6) Admin uses Admin Tools & Moderation to suspend/activate users, adjust billing exceptions, or resolve disputes.
7) Admin uses Export/Compliance to export data or enforce retention policies.
8) Admin toggles enterprise features via Feature Toggles for rollout planning.
9) All actions are recorded in AdminAuditLogs and visible in Audit Logs panel.

## Technical Specifications
- Data Models: See above under Backend; ensure JSON schema alignment for API payloads.
- API Endpoints: See REST/GraphQL endpoints outline above.
- Security:
  - Authentication: Admin/Privileged access required; OAuth2 or SSO as configured.
  - Authorization: Role-based checks; deny unknown or insufficient privileges.
  - Token Management: Secure issuance, refresh, revocation; single-use refresh tokens if supported.
- Validation:
  - Validate IDs, statuses, and permissions on all endpoints.
  - Validate input payloads for impersonation, escalation, export, and policy updates.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Admin Dashboard loads with real-time-like system health, usage, and queue metrics.
- [ ] Admin - User Management page lists workspaces with correct actions: impersonate, escalate, export.
- [ ] Impersonation flow triggers audit logs and requires explicit confirmation; sessions revert to admin context upon exit.
- [ ] Admin Tools & Moderation can suspend/activate users, manage workspaces, and apply billing exceptions with proper audit trails.
- [ ] Exports and retention policies can be created/modified and reflect in Audit Logs.
- [ ] All endpoints enforce role-based access control and return appropriate error codes for unauthorized actions.
- [ ] UI adheres to the design system: cards, tables, charts, and navigation match the Visual Style section.

## UI/UX Guidelines
Apply the project's design system:
- Use the Admin Dashboard shell with top pill-shaped navigation, consistent card styles, and data tables.
- Maintain the soft green/deep green accent for primary actions and active navigation.
- Status indicators use Bright Green (#7BE495), Soft Yellow (#FFE8A3), Muted Orange (#FFDCA8), and Light Red (#FF6C6C).
- Cards have white backgrounds (#FFFFFF), subtle shadows, rounded corners, 24px+ internal padding, and hover elevations.
- Data visualization uses clean, minimal charts with gentle gridlines; keep axes muted.
- Typography: Inter/SF Pro/Manrope-like geometric sans; weights 400/500/600 as specified.
- Layout: 8px spacing increments; 24-32px container padding; left-aligned content with strong vertical rhythm.
- Mobile-first: Ensure large tap targets and responsive stacking of panels.

This admin hub will connect tightly with Admin Tools & Moderation, User Authentication, Session Management, and Security/Privacy/Compliance features, and include a dedicated Admin - User Management page for live intervention, impersonation, and escalations.

## Page Description (Full Detail)
The Admin Dashboard is the central platform admin area designed to give operators visibility into the entire system and direct action capability. Goals:
- Provide a high-level overview of accounts, usage metrics, system health, and ongoing requests.
- Offer Admin Tools & Moderation capabilities to manage users, workspaces, billing exceptions, disputes, and support escalations.
- Ensure secure authentication flows, workspace life cycle management, and token/session lifecycle governance.
- Enforce data governance, retention, audit logging, and enterprise privacy controls with export capabilities.
- Supply a focused UI for Admin - User Management to view and intervene in customer workspaces, impersonate accounts for support, and perform escalations.

Connected features:
- Admin Tools & Moderation: Tools to block/disable accounts, modify workspaces, apply billing exceptions, resolve disputes, escalate support tickets.
- User Authentication: Sign-up/login flows, OAuth integrations, and creation/managing of workspaces tied to accounts.
- Session Management: Issue/refresh/revoke tokens, enforce single-use refresh tokens, monitor active sessions.
- Security, Privacy & Compliance: Data export, retention policies, audit logs, enterprise privacy controls.
- Admin - User Management: View and intervene in customer workspaces, impersonation for support, escalation actions.

UI guidance and expectations:
- High-level dashboards with Accounts Overview, System Health, Support Queue, Usage & Billing, and Feature Toggles.
- Card-based layout with clear hierarchies; tables with sortable columns; charts showing key metrics (uptime, errors, queue length, usage).
- Quick actions: impersonate, escalate, export data, apply policy changes, enable/disable features.
- Visual consistency with the project’s design system: soft shadows, rounded corners, gentle color palette, accessible typography, and responsive behavior.

Note: No external API integrations are mandated by the project context, but the design should be ready to connect to your existing services (auth, user/workspace management, billing, logs, and audit systems) via well-defined REST/GraphQL endpoints.

### Integration
- Data Flow
  - Admin Dashboard fetches summary data from /admin/dashboard/summary
  - Admin pages call respective endpoints for users, workspaces, disputes, exports
  - Impersonation actions route through a controlled session switch with audit logging
- Data Consistency
  - Maintain referential integrity between accounts, workspaces, and users
  - Propagate status changes across related entities (e.g., suspending a user updates workspace access)
- Event Handling
  - Admin actions emit events to audit/logging systems; optionally publish to a message bus for downstream analytics

## User Experience Flow
1) Admin logs in to /admin/dashboard with elevated privileges.
2) Admin reviews Overview: Accounts, System Health, Support Queue, Usage.
3) Admin navigates to Admin - User Management to view customer workspaces.
4) Admin selects a workspace; views details, initiates impersonation for support if needed.
5) If issues require escalation, Admin opens an escalation for the disputed workspace or billing irregularity.
6) Admin uses Admin Tools & Moderation to suspend/activate users, adjust billing exceptions, or resolve disputes.
7) Admin uses Export/Compliance to export data or enforce retention policies.
8) Admin toggles enterprise features via Feature Toggles for rollout planning.
9) All actions are recorded in AdminAuditLogs and visible in Audit Logs panel.

## Technical Specifications
- Data Models: See above under Backend; ensure JSON schema alignment for API payloads.
- API Endpoints: See REST/GraphQL endpoints outline above.
- Security:
  - Authentication: Admin/Privileged access required; OAuth2 or SSO as configured.
  - Authorization: Role-based checks; deny unknown or insufficient privileges.
  - Token Management: Secure issuance, refresh, revocation; single-use refresh tokens if supported.
- Validation:
  - Validate IDs, statuses, and permissions on all endpoints.
  - Validate input payloads for impersonation, escalation, export, and policy updates.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Admin Dashboard loads with real-time-like system health, usage, and queue metrics.
- [ ] Admin - User Management page lists workspaces with correct actions: impersonate, escalate, export.
- [ ] Impersonation flow triggers audit logs and requires explicit confirmation; sessions revert to admin context upon exit.
- [ ] Admin Tools & Moderation can suspend/activate users, manage workspaces, and apply billing exceptions with proper audit trails.

- Maintain the soft green/deep green accent for primary actions and active navigation.
- Status indicators use Bright Green (#7BE495), Soft Yellow (#FFE8A3), Muted Orange (#FFDCA8), and Light Red (#FF6C6C).
- Cards have white backgrounds (#FFFFFF), subtle shadows, rounded corners, 24px+ internal padding, and hover elevations.
- Data visualization uses clean, minimal charts with gentle gridlines; keep axes muted.
- Typography: Inter/SF Pro/Manrope-like geometric sans; weights 400/500/600 as specified.
- Layout: 8px spacing increments; 24-32px container padding; left-aligned content with strong vertical rhythm.
