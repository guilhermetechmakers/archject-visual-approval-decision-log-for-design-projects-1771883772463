# Modern Design Best Practices

## Philosophy

Create unique, memorable experiences while maintaining consistency through modern design principles. Every project should feel distinct yet professional, innovative yet intuitive.

---

## Landing Pages & Marketing Sites

### Hero Sections
**Go beyond static backgrounds:**
- Animated gradients with subtle movement
- Particle systems or geometric shapes floating
- Interactive canvas backgrounds (Three.js, WebGL)
- Video backgrounds with proper fallbacks
- Parallax scrolling effects
- Gradient mesh animations
- Morphing blob animations


### Layout Patterns
**Use modern grid systems:**
- Bento grids (asymmetric card layouts)
- Masonry layouts for varied content
- Feature sections with diagonal cuts or curves
- Overlapping elements with proper z-index
- Split-screen designs with scroll-triggered reveals

**Avoid:** Traditional 3-column equal grids

### Scroll Animations
**Engage users as they scroll:**
- Fade-in and slide-up animations for sections
- Scroll-triggered parallax effects
- Progress indicators for long pages
- Sticky elements that transform on scroll
- Horizontal scroll sections for portfolios
- Text reveal animations (word by word, letter by letter)
- Number counters animating into view

**Avoid:** Static pages with no scroll interaction

### Call-to-Action Areas
**Make CTAs impossible to miss:**
- Gradient buttons with hover effects
- Floating action buttons with micro-interactions
- Animated borders or glowing effects
- Scale/lift on hover
- Interactive elements that respond to mouse position
- Pulsing indicators for primary actions

---

## Dashboard Applications

### Layout Structure
**Always use collapsible side navigation:**
- Sidebar that can collapse to icons only
- Smooth transition animations between states
- Persistent navigation state (remember user preference)
- Mobile: drawer that slides in/out
- Desktop: sidebar with expand/collapse toggle
- Icons visible even when collapsed

**Structure:**
```
/dashboard (layout wrapper with sidebar)
  /dashboard/overview
  /dashboard/analytics
  /dashboard/settings
  /dashboard/users
  /dashboard/projects
```

All dashboard pages should be nested inside the dashboard layout, not separate routes.

### Data Tables
**Modern table design:**
- Sticky headers on scroll
- Row hover states with subtle elevation
- Sortable columns with clear indicators
- Pagination with items-per-page control
- Search/filter with instant feedback
- Selection checkboxes with bulk actions
- Responsive: cards on mobile, table on desktop
- Loading skeletons, not spinners
- Empty states with illustrations or helpful text

**Use modern table libraries:**
- TanStack Table (React Table v8)
- AG Grid for complex data
- Data Grid from MUI (if using MUI)

### Charts & Visualizations
**Use the latest charting libraries:**
- Recharts (for React, simple charts)
- Chart.js v4 (versatile, well-maintained)
- Apache ECharts (advanced, interactive)
- D3.js (custom, complex visualizations)
- Tremor (for dashboards, built on Recharts)

**Chart best practices:**
- Animated transitions when data changes
- Interactive tooltips with detailed info
- Responsive sizing
- Color scheme matching design system
- Legend placement that doesn't obstruct data
- Loading states while fetching data

### Dashboard Cards
**Metric cards should stand out:**
- Gradient backgrounds or colored accents
- Trend indicators (↑ ↓ with color coding)
- Sparkline charts for historical data
- Hover effects revealing more detail
- Icon representing the metric
- Comparison to previous period

---

## Color & Visual Design

### Color Palettes
**Create depth with gradients:**
- Primary gradient (not just solid primary color)
- Subtle background gradients
- Gradient text for headings
- Gradient borders on cards
- Elevated surfaces for depth

**Color usage:**
- 60-30-10 rule (dominant, secondary, accent)
- Consistent semantic colors (success, warning, error)
- Accessible contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum)

### Typography
**Create hierarchy through contrast:**
- Large, bold headings (48-72px for heroes)
- Clear size differences between levels
- Variable font weights (300, 400, 600, 700)
- Letter spacing for small caps
- Line height 1.5-1.7 for body text
- Inter, Poppins, or DM Sans for modern feel

### Shadows & Depth
**Layer UI elements:**
- Multi-layer shadows for realistic depth
- Colored shadows matching element color
- Elevated states on hover
- Neumorphism for special elements (sparingly)

---

## Interactions & Micro-animations

### Button Interactions
**Every button should react:**
- Scale slightly on hover (1.02-1.05)
- Lift with shadow on hover
- Ripple effect on click
- Loading state with spinner or progress
- Disabled state clearly visible
- Success state with checkmark animation

### Card Interactions
**Make cards feel alive:**
- Lift on hover with increased shadow
- Subtle border glow on hover
- Tilt effect following mouse (3D transform)
- Smooth transitions (200-300ms)
- Click feedback for interactive cards

### Form Interactions
**Guide users through forms:**
- Input focus states with border color change
- Floating labels that animate up
- Real-time validation with inline messages
- Success checkmarks for valid inputs
- Error states with shake animation
- Password strength indicators
- Character count for text areas

### Page Transitions
**Smooth between views:**
- Fade + slide for page changes
- Skeleton loaders during data fetch
- Optimistic UI updates
- Stagger animations for lists
- Route transition animations

---

## Mobile Responsiveness

### Mobile-First Approach
**Design for mobile, enhance for desktop:**
- Touch targets minimum 44x44px
- Generous padding and spacing
- Sticky bottom navigation on mobile
- Collapsible sections for long content
- Swipeable cards and galleries
- Pull-to-refresh where appropriate

### Responsive Patterns
**Adapt layouts intelligently:**
- Hamburger menu → full nav bar
- Card grid → stack on mobile
- Sidebar → drawer
- Multi-column → single column
- Data tables → card list
- Hide/show elements based on viewport

---

## Loading & Empty States

### Loading States
**Never leave users wondering:**
- Skeleton screens matching content layout
- Progress bars for known durations
- Animated placeholders
- Spinners only for short waits (<3s)
- Stagger loading for multiple elements
- Shimmer effects on skeletons

### Empty States
**Make empty states helpful:**
- Illustrations or icons
- Helpful copy explaining why it's empty
- Clear CTA to add first item
- Examples or suggestions
- No "no data" text alone

---

## Unique Elements to Stand Out

### Distinctive Features
**Add personality:**
- Custom cursor effects on landing pages
- Animated page numbers or section indicators
- Unusual hover effects (magnification, distortion)
- Custom scrollbars
- Glassmorphism for overlays
- Animated SVG icons
- Typewriter effects for hero text
- Confetti or celebration animations for actions

### Interactive Elements
**Engage users:**

 for bestpractices and # Terms of Service Development Prompt

Below is a complete, actionable prompt intended for an AI development tool to build the Terms of Service feature and the associated Legal Document Templates as described. It is structured to be directly fed into a design/engineering automation pipeline and includes precise deliverables, data models, API contracts, UI/UX guidelines, and acceptance criteria aligned with the PROJECT CONTEXT (Archject) and visual style guidelines provided.

---

## Terms of Service

## Overview
Create a dedicated Terms of Service page that communicates the platform’s terms of use, governing law, liability limitations, and service-level notes. This page should be a readable, legally compliant, and visually consistent component within the Archject product. It must support future localization, easy updates by non-technical staff, and clear presentation of the acceptance mechanism referenced during signup flows.

Goals
- Present platform terms of use, governing law, liability, and service-level notes in a clear, scannable format.
- Provide a legally binding, readable document with structured sections and navigable anchors.
- Ensure accessibility, responsive behavior, and print/export readiness (PDF-friendly layout).
- Support easy content updates and versioning; expose effective date and contact information.
- Integrate with design-system UI primitives and the existing Archject visual language (colors, typography, spacing).

---

## Page Description (Full Detail)
[MANDATORY: Provide a detailed page description immediately after Overview. Include what this page is, its goals, connected features, UI elements & visual guidance, and API integrations. Use the details provided in PROJECT CONTEXT.]

- Page purpose: A standalone Terms of Service document page that communicates:
  - Platform terms of use (permitted actions, user responsibilities, IP rights, license limitations, etc.).
  - Governing law and jurisdiction.
  - Liability limitations and disclaimers.
  - Service-level notes (uptime expectations, maintenance windows, support commitments, and any notice periods).
  - Effective date, last updated date, and contact information for inquiries.
- Structure:
  - Hero header with page title “Terms of Service” and effective date.
  - Table of contents with anchor links to major sections (Usage, Prohibited Actions, Intellectual Property, Liability, Service Levels, Indemnification, Governing Law, Dispute Resolution, Modifications, Termination, Contact).
  - Legally formatted content sections with clearly defined headings, paragraphs, and any bullet lists.
  - A conspicuous, non-intrusive “Accept/Consent” mechanism reference for signup (informational note that consent is captured during signup) and a separate “Export” option to print/export the page as PDF.
  - Footer with version/date stamps and contact/legal notice.
- UI/UX guidance:
  - Typography: long-form readability, comfortable line lengths, generous line-height.
  - Card-free main content surface but can use subtle section dividers and anchors for accessibility.
  - Visual guidance should align with the following visual style: clean, minimal, with white space; content remains primary; no distractions.
  - Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant, semantic headings, ARIA landmarks, keyboard navigable, proper focus order.
  - Print/export: The page should render cleanly to PDF with fixed header/footer and page breaks suitable for legal documents.
- API integrations:
  - No external API connections for this page in its basic rendering. Content should be statically stored with versioning support in the CMS/DB (see Data Models).
  - If content is edited, trigger a content versioning workflow and surface last updated date automatically.
- Content management:
  - Templates and content blocks should be modular to allow easy updates by legal/compliance teams.
  - A field for effective date, last updated date, and version number (auto-increment on edits).
- Localization readiness:
  - Prepare strings and layout to support translations without breaking layout (RTL/LTR considerations if required later).

---

## Components to Build
- TermsOfServicePage component
  - Subcomponents:
    - HeroHeader: Title, EffectiveDate
    - TableOfContents: Interactive anchor-based navigation
    - SectionRenderer: Renders each content block (Heading + Paragraphs + Lists)
    - AcceptConsentNote: Non-functional on this page but references signup consent mechanism
    - ExportPanel: PDF/Print button, preview modal if needed
    - VersionBar: LastUpdated, VersionNumber, LegalContact
  - Data-driven: Content blocks sourced from a structured document model (sections, subsections, bullets, links)
- LegalDocumentTemplateTemplates (asset)
  - Template content for:
    - Privacy Policy
    - Terms of Service
    - Exportable Decision Log cover pages (for PDF exports)
  - Each template should include placeholders for project name, effective date, version, and company branding.
  - Export logic to generate a PDF with consistent header/footer, page breaks, and page numbering.

---

## Implementation Requirements

### Frontend
- Page layout
  - Full-width hero area with title and date.
  - Left-aligned, readable content surface divided into semantic sections.
  - Table of Contents with sticky behavior on tall content (optional) and smooth scrolling to anchors.
  - Export/Print controls prominently placed in a card with subtle shadow.
- UI Components
  - Typography: Use Inter/SF Pro/Manrope-like sans-serif with 400/500/600 weights as specified.
  - Headings: H1 for page title, H2/H3 for sections, with consistent spacing (8px increments).
  - Lists: Bullet and numbered lists with clear indentation and spacing.
  - Anchors: Visible focus rings for keyboard navigation.
  - Buttons: Print/Export as primary action (soft outline or filled depending on design): prefer a subdued action style for legal content; consider a small print icon.
  - Links: Underlined or high-contrast to indicate external/legal references.
  - Accessibility: ARIA roles for landmark regions; landmark roles for main content; descriptive link text.
- Visual styling
  - Card usage should be minimal for the page content; if sections are card-like, apply subtle borders or shadows per design system.
  - Color usage: Text primary dark gray (#23272F); links in a muted accent color; no strong color emphasis on heavy legals beyond status or alert indicators (if used).
  - Shadows and borders: Light shadows (#E6E8F0) and borders (#D1D5DB) as separators.
- Interactivity
  - Smooth scroll to anchors; highlight active section in the TOC as the user scrolls.
  - Print/Export button triggers a print dialog or server-side PDF export endpoint (see API).
- API Integrations
  - None required for runtime fetch; content stored in CMS or content store. Prepare endpoints for content retrieval if a headless CMS is used (e.g., GET /legal/terms?version=...).

### Backend
- Data Models
  - LegalDocument
    - id: string
    - name: string (e.g., "Terms of Service")
    - version: int
    - effectiveDate: date
    - lastUpdated: date
    - sections: array of Section
    - brandingMeta: Branding info (logo URL, company name)
  - Section
    - id: string
    - title: string
    - contentBlocks: array of ContentBlock
  - ContentBlock
    - type: enum [paragraph, list, subheading, link, blockquote]
    - content: string (for paragraph/text)
    - bulletPoints: array<string> (for lists)
    - links: array<Link> (optional)
  - Link
    - text: string
    - href: string
  - Template
    - id: string
    - name: string
    - contentStructure: as LegalDocument with placeholders
- API Endpoints (optional for CMS-driven setup)
  - GET /legal/terms/latest
    - Returns current Terms of Service document
  - GET /legal/templates/privacy
  - GET /legal/templates/terms
  - POST /legal/documents/:id/versions
    - Create a new version after edits (admin/legal role required)
  - GET /legal/documents/:id/export/pdf
    - Generate and return a PDF export (server-side rendering with consistent header/footer)
- Export/Print service
  - A server-side PDF renderer (e.g., headless Chrome or PDF library) that consumes the document model and produces a well-formatted PDF with:
    - Header: Company branding, document name, version
    - Footer: Page numbers, date
    - Content: Structured sections with proper page breaks
  - Ensure export uses the same content blocks in a printable layout and supports an export-safe subset (no interactive elements)

### Integration
- Content source: The Terms of Service content is sourced from a structured legal document model (CMS or DB). The frontend fetches the latest version via GET /legal/terms/latest.
- Versioning: When legal edits occur, a new version is created via /legal/documents/:id/versions; the frontend should show the current effectiveDate and lastUpdated.
- PDF Export: Frontend triggers /legal/documents/:id/export/pdf; the backend generates a printable PDF and returns a download URL or binary content.
- Localization: Prepare the API to surface locale-specific content if localization is introduced; the UI should switch strings via locale keys.

---

## User Experience Flow
1. User navigates to the Terms of Service page from the footer or legal section.
2. Page loads the latest Terms content, showing:
   - Title and Effective Date
   - Table of Contents with anchors
   - Content sections (Usage, Prohibited Actions, IP, Liability, Service Levels, Modifications, Termination, Contact)
3. User reads content; can scroll with a highlighted TOC reflecting the current section.
4. User may click Export to PDF:
   - Frontend calls the PDF export endpoint.
   - Server renders the PDF; user receives a download prompt or in-app PDF viewer.
5. Admin/legal user edits content:
   - Create a new version via CMS or API.
   - Publish; new version metadata updates EffectiveDate and LastUpdated.
   - All users see the latest version automatically.

---

## Technical Specifications

Data Models: 
- LegalDocument
  - id: string (uuid)
  - name: string
  - version: int
  - effectiveDate: date
  - lastUpdated: date
  - sections: Section[]
  - brandingMeta: { companyName: string, logoUrl?: string }
- Section
  - id: string

  - type: string (paragraph|list|subheading|link|blockquote)
  - content: string
  - bulletPoints?: string[]
  - links?: Link[]
- Link
  - text: string
  - href: string

API Endpoints:
- GET /legal/terms/latest -> LegalDocument (id, version, effectiveDate, sections)
- GET /legal/templates/{name} -> Template content for privacy/terms
- POST /legal/documents/{id}/versions -> Create new version; body includes updated sections
- GET /legal/documents/{id}/export/pdf -> binary application/pdf

Security:
- Authentication: Admin/Legal roles required for version creation and template updates. Public GET for latest Terms (read-only).
- Authorization: Enforce access control on versioning endpoints.
- Data integrity: Validate version increments; ensure effectiveDate <= lastUpdated ≤ now.
- Data privacy: No sensitive user data in document content.

Validation:
- Content validation: Each section must have title; contentBlocks must have valid types; lists must have at least one bulletPoint when type is list.
- URL validation for links.
- Date validation for effectiveDate and lastUpdated.
- PDF export should succeed for valid document IDs; handle errors gracefully.

---

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The Terms of Service page renders with:
  - Title, effective date, and last updated date.
  - Table of Contents with working anchors and active-section highlighting on scroll.
  - All content sections rendered from structured data; supports lists, links, and subheadings.
  - Print/Export to PDF functionality producing a properly formatted document with header/footer and page numbers.
- [ ] The UI adheres to the defined visual style (colors, typography, spacing, and card/shadow usage) and is accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA).
- [ ] Content management: Admin can create a new version; versioning metadata updates correctly (version number increments, effectiveDate and lastUpdated reflect changes).
- [ ] Internationalization readiness: Strings plumbed via locale keys; layout accommodates translations without breaking layout (RTL support not required immediately but future-proofed).
- [ ] No external API dependencies required for the page rendering; content comes from the internal legal document store.

---

## UI/UX Guidelines
Apply the project's design system:

- Card Design
  - Prefer minimal surface; if section blocks use cards, apply 24px minimum padding and subtle shadows (0 4px 16px rgba(34, 42, 89, 0.05)).
  - Borderless surfaces; separators via whitespace and light shadows.
  - Hover states: N/A for static legal content; ensure focus rings for interactive anchors.

- Navigation
  - Top navigation remains primary for app; Terms page uses a clean content surface with an optional compact TOC.
  - TOC should be accessible: keyboard navigable, focus visible, and highlight active section as user scrolls.

- Data Visualization
  - Not required on this page; if included for related dashboards, reuse the Archject chart styling guidelines.

- Interactive Elements
  - Export button: primary action style should be subtle for legal content; consistent iconography (PDF/Print).
  - Links and citations use accessible contrast.

- Design Philosophy
  - Trust, clarity, and accessibility are paramount. Content-first approach with generous white space and legible typography.
  - Mobile-first considerations: large tap targets for anchors, readable line-lengths, and responsive typography.

# Terms of Service Development Prompt

Below is a complete, actionable prompt intended for an AI development tool to build the Terms of Service feature and the associated Legal Document Templates as described. It is structured to be directly fed into a design/engineering automation pipeline and includes precise deliverables, data models, API contracts, UI/UX guidelines, and acceptance criteria aligned with the PROJECT CONTEXT (Archject) and visual style guidelines provided.

---

## Terms of Service

## Overview
Create a dedicated Terms of Service page that communicates the platform’s terms of use, governing law, liability limitations, and service-level notes. This page should be a readable, legally compliant, and visually consistent component within the Archject product. It must support future localization, easy updates by non-technical staff, and clear presentation of the acceptance mechanism referenced during signup flows.

Goals
- Present platform terms of use, governing law, liability, and service-level notes in a clear, scannable format.
- Provide a legally binding, readable document with structured sections and navigable anchors.
- Ensure accessibility, responsive behavior, and print/export readiness (PDF-friendly layout).
- Support easy content updates and versioning; expose effective date and contact information.
- Integrate with design-system UI primitives and the existing Archject visual language (colors, typography, spacing).

---

## Page Description (Full Detail)
[MANDATORY: Provide a detailed page description immediately after Overview. Include what this page is, its goals, connected features, UI elements & visual guidance, and API integrations. Use the details provided in PROJECT CONTEXT.]

- Page purpose: A standalone Terms of Service document page that communicates:
  - Platform terms of use (permitted actions, user responsibilities, IP rights, license limitations, etc.).
  - Governing law and jurisdiction.
  - Liability limitations and disclaimers.
  - Service-level notes (uptime expectations, maintenance windows, support commitments, and any notice periods).
  - Effective date, last updated date, and contact information for inquiries.
- Structure:
  - Hero header with page title “Terms of Service” and effective date.
  - Table of contents with anchor links to major sections (Usage, Prohibited Actions, Intellectual Property, Liability, Service Levels, Indemnification, Governing Law, Dispute Resolution, Modifications, Termination, Contact).
  - Legally formatted content sections with clearly defined headings, paragraphs, and any bullet lists.
  - A conspicuous, non-intrusive “Accept/Consent” mechanism reference for signup (informational note that consent is captured during signup) and a separate “Export” option to print/export the page as PDF.
  - Footer with version/date stamps and contact/legal notice.
- UI/UX guidance:
  - Typography: long-form readability, comfortable line lengths, generous line-height.
  - Card-free main content surface but can use subtle section dividers and anchors for accessibility.
  - Visual guidance should align with the following visual style: clean, minimal, with white space; content remains primary; no distractions.
  - Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant, semantic headings, ARIA landmarks, keyboard navigable, proper focus order.
  - Print/export: The page should render cleanly to PDF with fixed header/footer and page breaks suitable for legal documents.
- API integrations:
  - No external API connections for this page in its basic rendering. Content should be statically stored with versioning support in the CMS/DB (see Data Models).
  - If content is edited, trigger a content versioning workflow and surface last updated date automatically.
- Content management:
  - Templates and content blocks should be modular to allow easy updates by legal/compliance teams.
  - A field for effective date, last updated date, and version number (auto-increment on edits).
- Localization readiness:
  - Prepare strings and layout to support translations without breaking layout (RTL/LTR considerations if required later).

---

## Components to Build
- TermsOfServicePage component
  - Subcomponents:
    - HeroHeader: Title, EffectiveDate
    - TableOfContents: Interactive anchor-based navigation
    - SectionRenderer: Renders each content block (Heading + Paragraphs + Lists)
    - AcceptConsentNote: Non-functional on this page but references signup consent mechanism
    - ExportPanel: PDF/Print button, preview modal if needed
    - VersionBar: LastUpdated, VersionNumber, LegalContact
  - Data-driven: Content blocks sourced from a structured document model (sections, subsections, bullets, links)
- LegalDocumentTemplateTemplates (asset)
  - Template content for:
    - Privacy Policy
    - Terms of Service
    - Exportable Decision Log cover pages (for PDF exports)
  - Each template should include placeholders for project name, effective date, version, and company branding.
  - Export logic to generate a PDF with consistent header/footer, page breaks, and page numbering.

---

## Implementation Requirements

### Frontend
- Page layout
  - Full-width hero area with title and date.
  - Left-aligned, readable content surface divided into semantic sections.
  - Table of Contents with sticky behavior on tall content (optional) and smooth scrolling to anchors.
  - Export/Print controls prominently placed in a card with subtle shadow.
- UI Components
  - Typography: Use Inter/SF Pro/Manrope-like sans-serif with 400/500/600 weights as specified.
  - Headings: H1 for page title, H2/H3 for sections, with consistent spacing (8px increments).
  - Lists: Bullet and numbered lists with clear indentation and spacing.
  - Anchors: Visible focus rings for keyboard navigation.
  - Buttons: Print/Export as primary action (soft outline or filled depending on design): prefer a subdued action style for legal content; consider a small print icon.
  - Links: Underlined or high-contrast to indicate external/legal references.
  - Accessibility: ARIA roles for landmark regions; landmark roles for main content; descriptive link text.
- Visual styling
  - Card usage should be minimal for the page content; if sections are card-like, apply subtle borders or shadows per design system.
  - Color usage: Text primary dark gray (#23272F); links in a muted accent color; no strong color emphasis on heavy legals beyond status or alert indicators (if used).
  - Shadows and borders: Light shadows (#E6E8F0) and borders (#D1D5DB) as separators.
- Interactivity
  - Smooth scroll to anchors; highlight active section in the TOC as the user scrolls.
  - Print/Export button triggers a print dialog or server-side PDF export endpoint (see API).
- API Integrations
  - None required for runtime fetch; content stored in CMS or content store. Prepare endpoints for content retrieval if a headless CMS is used (e.g., GET /legal/terms?version=...).

### Backend
- Data Models
  - LegalDocument
    - id: string
    - name: string (e.g., "Terms of Service")
    - version: int
    - effectiveDate: date
    - lastUpdated: date
    - sections: array of Section
    - brandingMeta: Branding info (logo URL, company name)
  - Section
    - id: string
    - title: string
    - contentBlocks: array of ContentBlock
  - ContentBlock
    - type: enum [paragraph, list, subheading, link, blockquote]
    - content: string (for paragraph/text)
    - bulletPoints: array<string> (for lists)
    - links: array<Link> (optional)
  - Link
    - text: string
    - href: string
  - Template
    - id: string
    - name: string
    - contentStructure: as LegalDocument with placeholders
- API Endpoints (optional for CMS-driven setup)
  - GET /legal/terms/latest
    - Returns current Terms of Service document
  - GET /legal/templates/privacy
  - GET /legal/templates/terms
  - POST /legal/documents/:id/versions
    - Create a new version after edits (admin/legal role required)
  - GET /legal/documents/:id/export/pdf
    - Generate and return a PDF export (server-side rendering with consistent header/footer)
- Export/Print service
  - A server-side PDF renderer (e.g., headless Chrome or PDF library) that consumes the document model and produces a well-formatted PDF with:
    - Header: Company branding, document name, version
    - Footer: Page numbers, date
    - Content: Structured sections with proper page breaks
  - Ensure export uses the same content blocks in a printable layout and supports an export-safe subset (no interactive elements)

### Integration
- Content source: The Terms of Service content is sourced from a structured legal document model (CMS or DB). The frontend fetches the latest version via GET /legal/terms/latest.
- Versioning: When legal edits occur, a new version is created via /legal/documents/:id/versions; the frontend should show the current effectiveDate and lastUpdated.
- PDF Export: Frontend triggers /legal/documents/:id/export/pdf; the backend generates a printable PDF and returns a download URL or binary content.
- Localization: Prepare the API to surface locale-specific content if localization is introduced; the UI should switch strings via locale keys.

---

## User Experience Flow
1. User navigates to the Terms of Service page from the footer or legal section.
2. Page loads the latest Terms content, showing:
   - Title and Effective Date
   - Table of Contents with anchors
   - Content sections (Usage, Prohibited Actions, IP, Liability, Service Levels, Modifications, Termination, Contact)
3. User reads content; can scroll with a highlighted TOC reflecting the current section.
4. User may click Export to PDF:
   - Frontend calls the PDF export endpoint.
   - Server renders the PDF; user receives a download prompt or in-app PDF viewer.
5. Admin/legal user edits content:
   - Create a new version via CMS or API.
   - Publish; new version metadata updates EffectiveDate and LastUpdated.
   - All users see the latest version automatically.

---

## Technical Specifications

Data Models: 
- LegalDocument
  - id: string (uuid)
  - name: string
  - version: int
  - effectiveDate: date
  - lastUpdated: date
  - sections: Section[]
  - brandingMeta: { companyName: string, logoUrl?: string }
- Section
  - id: string
  - title: string
  - contentBlocks: ContentBlock[]
- ContentBlock
  - type: string (paragraph|list|subheading|link|blockquote)
  - content: string
  - bulletPoints?: string[]
  - links?: Link[]
- Link
  - text: string
  - href: string

API Endpoints:
- GET /legal/terms/latest -> LegalDocument (id, version, effectiveDate, sections)
- GET /legal/templates/{name} -> Template content for privacy/terms
- POST /legal/documents/{id}/versions -> Create new version; body includes updated sections
- GET /legal/documents/{id}/export/pdf -> binary application/pdf

Security:
- Authentication: Admin/Legal roles required for version creation and template updates. Public GET for latest Terms (read-only).
- Authorization: Enforce access control on versioning endpoints.
- Data integrity: Validate version increments; ensure effectiveDate <= lastUpdated ≤ now.
- Data privacy: No sensitive user data in document content.

Validation:
- Content validation: Each section must have title; contentBlocks must have valid types; lists must have at least one bulletPoint when type is list.
- URL validation for links.
- Date validation for effectiveDate and lastUpdated.
- PDF export should succeed for valid document IDs; handle errors gracefully.

---

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] The Terms of Service page renders with:
  - Title, effective date, and last updated date.
  - Table of Contents with working anchors and active-section highlighting on scroll.
  - All content sections rendered from structured data; supports lists, links, and subheadings.
  - Print/Export to PDF functionality producing a properly formatted document with header/footer and page numbers.
- [ ] The UI adheres to the defined visual style (colors, typography, spacing, and card/shadow usage) and is accessible (WCAG 2.1 AA).
- [ ] Content management: Admin can create a new version; versioning metadata updates correctly (version number increments, effectiveDate and lastUpdated reflect changes).
- [ ] Internationalization readiness: Strings plumbed via locale keys; layout accommodates translations without breaking layout (RTL support not required immediately but future-proofed).
- [ ] No external API dependencies required for the page rendering; content comes from the internal legal document store.

---

## UI/UX Guidelines
Apply the project's design system:

- Card Design
  - Prefer minimal surface; if section blocks use cards, apply 24px minimum padding and subtle shadows (0 4px 16px rgba(34, 42, 89, 0.05)).
  - Borderless surfaces; separators via whitespace and light shadows.
  - Hover states: N/A for static legal content; ensure focus rings for interactive anchors.

- Navigation
  - Top navigation remains primary for app; Terms page uses a clean content surface with an optional compact TOC.
  - TOC should be accessible: keyboard navigable, focus visible, and highlight active section as user scrolls.

- Data Visualization
  - Not required on this page; if included for related dashboards, reuse the Archject chart styling guidelines.

- Interactive Elements
  - Export button: primary action style should be subtle for legal content; consistent iconography (PDF/Print).
  - Links and citations use accessible contrast.

- Design Philosophy
  - Trust, clarity, and accessibility are paramount. Content-first approach with generous white space and legible typography.
  - Mobile-first considerations: large tap targets for anchors, readable line-lengths, and responsive typography.

- Visual Style (as provided)
  - Color Palette: adhere to the specified soft whites, grays, greens, yellows, oranges, and reds for status indicators if used.
  - Typography: Inter/SF Pro/Manrope-like; weights 400/500/600 as described.
  - Layout: 24-32px container padding, 16-24px between components, 8px spacing increments.
  - Card & Navigation details: as specified above.
