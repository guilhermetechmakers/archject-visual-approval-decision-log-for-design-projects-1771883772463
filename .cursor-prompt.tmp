# Project-Specific Customizations

**IMPORTANT: This section contains the specific design requirements for THIS project. The guidelines above are universal best practices - these customizations below take precedence for project-specific decisions.**

## User Design Requirements

Client Portal and Internal Decision Detail.
  - Card-based, grid layouts, accessible components, responsive behavior (mobile-first).
  - Inline media annotation tools with zoom/pan, scrubber for media timeline (if applicable).
  - Rich text input with mention suggestions, emoji support optional.

---

## Implementation Requirements

### Frontend
- Build a cohesive design system-aligned UI:
  - Reusable React/Vue/Svelte components (Card, Button, Input, Tag, Tabs, MediaViewer, AnnotationOverlay, CommentThread).
  - MediaAnnotationOverlay component capable of rendering shapes, showing metadata, and allowing edits by authorized users.
  - CommentThread component with nested replies, edit/delete windows, mention highlighting, and inline actions (edit, delete, resolve).
  - Side-by-side OptionComparison component: responsive grid that adapts to viewport; shows media, specs, cost, and decision notes per option.
  - Real-time update indicators (typing, new comments, annotation changes).

- Pages:
  - Client Portal (No-login Link):
    - Route: /client-portal/:decisionToken
    - Features: authentication via token, side-by-side comparison, comment composer with mentions, annotation-capable media, approve/change-request actions, optional OTP flow.
  - Decision Detail (Internal):
    - Route: /internal/decisions/:decisionId
    - Features: full decision data, option-by-option annotations, audit trail, export controls, moderation tools, admin actions.

- Accessibility:
  - ARIA roles, keyboard navigable, proper focus management, readable contrast (WCAG 2.1 AA).

- Internationalization:
  - Prepare for i18n (text keys, date/number localization) if needed.

- Performance:
  - Lazy loading of options/media, pagination for comments, efficient annotation rendering for large media.
  - Debounced input for comment typing, optimistic UI updates.

- Mobile-first considerations:
  - Stacked layout with collapsible sections, touch-friendly controls, and large tap targets.

- Testing:
  - Unit tests for models and services, integration tests for end-to-end comment flow, WebSocket events, and export generation.

### Backend
- Data Models (SQL/NoSQL as appropriate):
  - User: id, name, email, role, preferences.
  - Project: id, name, branding tokens, default settings.
  - Decision: id, project_id, title, status (pending/approved/revoked/needs_changes), created_at, updated_at, approved_by, approved_at, revoked_at.
  - Option: id, decision_id, title, description, media_ids, specs, price, comparison_rank.
  - Media: id, asset_url, type (image/pdf/3d), media_metadata, linked_annotations (array of annotation_ids).
  - Annotation: id, media_id, option_id (nullable), shape_type (point/rect/polygon), coordinates (JSON), created_by, created_at, updated_by, updated_at, note.
  - Comment: id, decision_id, option_id (nullable), parent_id (nullable for threading), author_id, text, mentions (array of user_ids), created_at, updated_at, edited_by, edited_at, status (active/edited/deleted).
  - Notification: id, user_id, type (mention/comment/approval), reference_id, read_at, created_at.
  - ApprovalHistory: id, decision_id, user_id, action (created/approved/rejected/edited), timestamp, details (JSON).
  - Export: id, decision_id, type (pdf/json/csv), generated_at, url.

- APIs (REST or GraphQL):
  - Decisions
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}
    - POST /api/decisions
    - PUT /api/decisions/{id}
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/approve
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/revoke
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}/export
  - Options
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}/options
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/options
  - Media-Annotations
    - POST /api/media/{media_id}/annotations
    - PUT /api/annotations/{id}
    - DELETE /api/annotations/{id}
    - GET /api/media/{media_id}/annotations
  - Comments
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}/comments
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/comments
    - PUT /api/comments/{id}
    - DELETE /api/comments/{id}
  - Mentions & Notifications
    - POST /api/notifications/mention
    - GET /api/notifications?user_id=...
  - Real-time
    - WebSocket channel endpoints for /ws/decisions/{decisionId}
  - Exports
    - GET /api/exports/{export_id}
  - Auth
    - OAuth2 / JWT-based authentication; token validation; role checks.

- Database indexing and constraints:
  - Index on decision_id for comments, annotations; index on media_id; composite indexes for option and decision lookups.
  - Foreign keys: decision -> project; option -> decision; annotation -> media/option; comment -> decision/option/parent; notification -> user.

- Real-time & Messaging:
  - WebSocket channels per decision for comments and annotation updates.
  - Fallback to long-polling if WebSockets unavailable.
  - Debounce rapid comment streams; ensure at-least-once delivery semantics.

- Security:
  - No-login access tokens for client portal with expiration; token rotation.
  - Server-side validation for all inputs; server-side enforcement of business rules (e.g., cannot approve after revoke).
  - Rate limiting on comment POSTs and OTP validation; detect and mitigate abuse.

- Data Integrity & Auditing:
  - Immutable audit entries for approvals and edits; versioning for comments and annotations (with delta diffs if feasible).
  - Export exports reproduce exact state snapshots with timestamps.

### Integration
- Client Portal and Internal Decision Detail both consume the same backend APIs:
  - Shared data models for decisions, options, media, comments, and annotations.
  - Client Portal uses a token-based access path with read/write scoped permissions; Limited comment actions, no admin controls.
  - Internal view uses full permissions (create/edit/delete, export, revoke).

- Branding & Theming:
  - Centralized design tokens for colors, font sizes, spacing, radii.
  - Components should adapt to the brand’s palette and be override-ready for client-specific branding.

- Error Handling:
  - Consistent error payload structure; user-friendly messages; telemetry hooks for errors.

---

## User Experience Flow

1) Client Portal (No-login Link)
- Client opens a shareable link to a decision with side-by-side options.
- Client views media and option details; annotations are visible and can be added by authorized clients if permitted.
- Client adds a comment, optionally mentioning internal team members. Comment appears in real-time or near real-time.
- Client annotates media coordinates to indicate preferences or concerns (where allowed).
- Client can approve or request changes, optionally leaving a short note; action triggers a notification to internal stakeholders.
- If OTP/verification is enabled:
  - Client enters email (if captured) or phone to receive an OTP.
  - Client enters OTP to validate before submitting approval or comments beyond a basic level.
- Notifications: when a new comment or mention appears, the client gets a notification via the chosen channel.

2) Internal Decision Detail (Admin)
- Internal user logs in to /internal/decisions/{decisionId}.
- See the decision overview with status, timestamps, and approval history.
- Open each option to view side-by-side comparisons, related media, and inline annotations.
- View and reply to comments; edit or delete comments within allowed windows; resolve comments if applicable.
- Add annotations to media; modify existing annotations or create new ones; link annotations to specific options if needed.
- Admin actions:
  - Edit decision details, revise option data, or adjust approvals.
  - Revoke approvals with rationale; log revoke reason in ApprovalHistory.
  - Export decision logs to PDF/JSON/CSV; download or share export URL.
- Real-time updates ensure parallel editors see changes instantly.

3) Notifications & Mentions
- Mentions trigger in-app notifications; mention recipients are auto-tagged and alerted.
- Clients and internal users receive notifications about:
  - New comments, replies, or annotations.
  - Status changes (approved, changes requested, revoked).
  - Mentions and upcoming deadlines/reminders.

4) Moderation
- Moderators can edit/delete inappropriate content within allowed windows.
- Moderation logs captured with user and timestamp.

**Never leave users wondering:**
- Skeleton screens matching content layout
- Progress bars for known durations
- Animated placeholders
- Spinners only for short waits (<3s)
- Stagger loading for multiple elements
- Shimmer effects on skeletons

### Empty States
**Make empty states helpful:**
- Illustrations or icons
- Helpful copy explaining why it's empty
- Clear CTA to add first item
- Examples or suggestions
- No "no data" text alone

- Border radius values
- Animation timing (200ms, 300ms, 500ms)
- Color system (primary, secondary, accent, neutrals)
- Typography scale
- Icon style (outline vs filled)
- Button styles across the app
- Form element styles

### What Can Vary
**Project-specific customization:**
- Color palette (different colors, same system)
- Layout creativity (grids, asymmetry)
- Illustration style
- Animation personality
- Feature-specific interactions

# Project-Specific Customizations

**IMPORTANT: This section contains the specific design requirements for THIS project. The guidelines above are universal best practices - these customizations below take precedence for project-specific decisions.**

## User Design Requirements

Client Portal and Internal Decision Detail.
  - Card-based, grid layouts, accessible components, responsive behavior (mobile-first).
  - Inline media annotation tools with zoom/pan, scrubber for media timeline (if applicable).
  - Rich text input with mention suggestions, emoji support optional.

---

## Implementation Requirements

### Frontend
- Build a cohesive design system-aligned UI:
  - Reusable React/Vue/Svelte components (Card, Button, Input, Tag, Tabs, MediaViewer, AnnotationOverlay, CommentThread).
  - MediaAnnotationOverlay component capable of rendering shapes, showing metadata, and allowing edits by authorized users.
  - CommentThread component with nested replies, edit/delete windows, mention highlighting, and inline actions (edit, delete, resolve).
  - Side-by-side OptionComparison component: responsive grid that adapts to viewport; shows media, specs, cost, and decision notes per option.
  - Real-time update indicators (typing, new comments, annotation changes).

- Pages:
  - Client Portal (No-login Link):
    - Route: /client-portal/:decisionToken
    - Features: authentication via token, side-by-side comparison, comment composer with mentions, annotation-capable media, approve/change-request actions, optional OTP flow.
  - Decision Detail (Internal):
    - Route: /internal/decisions/:decisionId
    - Features: full decision data, option-by-option annotations, audit trail, export controls, moderation tools, admin actions.

- Accessibility:
  - ARIA roles, keyboard navigable, proper focus management, readable contrast (WCAG 2.1 AA).

- Internationalization:
  - Prepare for i18n (text keys, date/number localization) if needed.

- Performance:
  - Lazy loading of options/media, pagination for comments, efficient annotation rendering for large media.
  - Debounced input for comment typing, optimistic UI updates.

- Mobile-first considerations:
  - Stacked layout with collapsible sections, touch-friendly controls, and large tap targets.

- Testing:
  - Unit tests for models and services, integration tests for end-to-end comment flow, WebSocket events, and export generation.

### Backend
- Data Models (SQL/NoSQL as appropriate):
  - User: id, name, email, role, preferences.
  - Project: id, name, branding tokens, default settings.
  - Decision: id, project_id, title, status (pending/approved/revoked/needs_changes), created_at, updated_at, approved_by, approved_at, revoked_at.
  - Option: id, decision_id, title, description, media_ids, specs, price, comparison_rank.
  - Media: id, asset_url, type (image/pdf/3d), media_metadata, linked_annotations (array of annotation_ids).
  - Annotation: id, media_id, option_id (nullable), shape_type (point/rect/polygon), coordinates (JSON), created_by, created_at, updated_by, updated_at, note.
  - Comment: id, decision_id, option_id (nullable), parent_id (nullable for threading), author_id, text, mentions (array of user_ids), created_at, updated_at, edited_by, edited_at, status (active/edited/deleted).
  - Notification: id, user_id, type (mention/comment/approval), reference_id, read_at, created_at.
  - ApprovalHistory: id, decision_id, user_id, action (created/approved/rejected/edited), timestamp, details (JSON).
  - Export: id, decision_id, type (pdf/json/csv), generated_at, url.

- APIs (REST or GraphQL):
  - Decisions
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}
    - POST /api/decisions
    - PUT /api/decisions/{id}
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/approve
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/revoke
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}/export
  - Options
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}/options
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/options
  - Media-Annotations
    - POST /api/media/{media_id}/annotations
    - PUT /api/annotations/{id}
    - DELETE /api/annotations/{id}
    - GET /api/media/{media_id}/annotations
  - Comments
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}/comments
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/comments
    - PUT /api/comments/{id}
    - DELETE /api/comments/{id}
  - Mentions & Notifications
    - POST /api/notifications/mention
    - GET /api/notifications?user_id=...
  - Real-time
    - WebSocket channel endpoints for /ws/decisions/{decisionId}
  - Exports
    - GET /api/exports/{export_id}
  - Auth
    - OAuth2 / JWT-based authentication; token validation; role checks.

- Database indexing and constraints:
  - Index on decision_id for comments, annotations; index on media_id; composite indexes for option and decision lookups.
  - Foreign keys: decision -> project; option -> decision; annotation -> media/option; comment -> decision/option/parent; notification -> user.

- Real-time & Messaging:
  - WebSocket channels per decision for comments and annotation updates.
  - Fallback to long-polling if WebSockets unavailable.
  - Debounce rapid comment streams; ensure at-least-once delivery semantics.

- Security:
  - No-login access tokens for client portal with expiration; token rotation.
  - Server-side validation for all inputs; server-side enforcement of business rules (e.g., cannot approve after revoke).
  - Rate limiting on comment POSTs and OTP validation; detect and mitigate abuse.

- Data Integrity & Auditing:
  - Immutable audit entries for approvals and edits; versioning for comments and annotations (with delta diffs if feasible).
  - Export exports reproduce exact state snapshots with timestamps.

### Integration
- Client Portal and Internal Decision Detail both consume the same backend APIs:
  - Shared data models for decisions, options, media, comments, and annotations.
  - Client Portal uses a token-based access path with read/write scoped permissions; Limited comment actions, no admin controls.
  - Internal view uses full permissions (create/edit/delete, export, revoke).

- Branding & Theming:
  - Centralized design tokens for colors, font sizes, spacing, radii.
  - Components should adapt to the brand’s palette and be override-ready for client-specific branding.

- Error Handling:
  - Consistent error payload structure; user-friendly messages; telemetry hooks for errors.

---

## User Experience Flow

1) Client Portal (No-login Link)
- Client opens a shareable link to a decision with side-by-side options.
- Client views media and option details; annotations are visible and can be added by authorized clients if permitted.
- Client adds a comment, optionally mentioning internal team members. Comment appears in real-time or near real-time.
- Client annotates media coordinates to indicate preferences or concerns (where allowed).
- Client can approve or request changes, optionally leaving a short note; action triggers a notification to internal stakeholders.
- If OTP/verification is enabled:
  - Client enters email (if captured) or phone to receive an OTP.
  - Client enters OTP to validate before submitting approval or comments beyond a basic level.
- Notifications: when a new comment or mention appears, the client gets a notification via the chosen channel.

2) Internal Decision Detail (Admin)
- Internal user logs in to /internal/decisions/{decisionId}.
- See the decision overview with status, timestamps, and approval history.
- Open each option to view side-by-side comparisons, related media, and inline annotations.
- View and reply to comments; edit or delete comments within allowed windows; resolve comments if applicable.
- Add annotations to media; modify existing annotations or create new ones; link annotations to specific options if needed.
- Admin actions:
  - Edit decision details, revise option data, or adjust approvals.
  - Revoke approvals with rationale; log revoke reason in ApprovalHistory.
  - Export decision logs to PDF/JSON/CSV; download or share export URL.
- Real-time updates ensure parallel editors see changes instantly.

3) Notifications & Mentions
- Mentions trigger in-app notifications; mention recipients are auto-tagged and alerted.
- Clients and internal users receive notifications about:
  - New comments, replies, or annotations.
  - Status changes (approved, changes requested, revoked).
  - Mentions and upcoming deadlines/reminders.

4) Moderation
- Moderators can edit/delete inappropriate content within allowed windows.
- Moderation logs captured with user and timestamp.

 for bestpractices and # Decision Templates Library

## Overview
This prompt instructs an AI development tool to build the Decision Templates Library for Archject, a focused approval and decision-tracking solution for design projects. The system will provide opinionated, reusable templates for common decision types (finishes, layouts, change requests) to accelerate decision creation, paired with a robust Decisions List / Content Browser, a multi-step Create/Edit Decision Page, and a Project Workspace Page. The deliverables enable canonical decision management, visual side-by-side option comparisons, automated reminders, and policy-driven approvals, all within Archject’s branding and design system.

## Components to Build
1) Decision Templates Library (opinionated templates)
- Purpose: Define reusable decision templates for common decision types (e.g., finishes, layouts, change requests) with predefined metadata, required fields, default approval rules, and option sets.
- Data model: Template with fields for name, type, description, required metadata, option schemas (images, specs, layouts), default approval rules, versioning, usage analytics.
- APIs: CRUD for templates (workspace admins and shared/public templates), apply-template to prepopulate decision flow, analytics hooks (usage counts, last-used, success rate).
- UX considerations: Template catalog with search, categories, preview of template structure, “Apply Template” action that preloads the Create Decision flow with template defaults, audit trail of template usage.

2) Decisions List / Content Browser
- Purpose: Canonical list of all decisions across a project with robust filtering, sortable views, and quick previews. Bulk actions include share links, export, and status changes.
- Data model: Decision objects linked to projects, with fields for metadata, status, assignees, due dates, options, version, and audit trail.
- Features:
  - Filters: by status, type, assignee, due date, priority, template used, creation date, tags, and custom facets.
  - Bulk actions: share link generation, export (CSV/JSON/PDF), bulk status updates, bulk assignee changes, bulk export of decision packs.
  - Quick preview: inline panel with summary cards, key options, and a one-click open to full editor.
  - Sorting and views: list, card, and table views; saved filters and recently viewed.
  - Permissions: workspace admins and project members with appropriate read/write controls.
- UX: Card layouts with status badges, option thumbnails, and flow indicators; large tap targets; keyboard accessible controls.

3) Create / Edit Decision Page (Multi-step Editor)
- Purpose: Create or edit a Decision Object via a guided, multi-step flow.
- Steps (modular, collapsible):
  1) Metadata: title, decision type (from templates or custom), project association, category, priority, due date, tags.
  2) Options Upload: upload and manage options (images, specifications, layouts, CAD exports); drag-and-drop uploader; validation for file types and max sizes; thumbnails; option-level metadata.
  3) Side-by-Side Comparison Setup: define groups/columns, align options, compare trade-offs with visual diff of materials, finishes, costs; allow users to mark favored options.
  4) Approval Rules: define approvers, approval workflow stages, required sign-offs, escalation policies, conditional rules.
  5) Assignee & Schedule: assign owner, set reminders (email, in-app, calendar), due date, and escalation notifications.
  6) Review & Publish: summary, validation, generate shareable link, archive/clone, or finalize decision with timestamped approval.
- Features:
  - Real-time collaboration-friendly editor with change tracking and comments per step.
  - Validation: required fields per decision type, file-size limits, and approval rule consistency.
  - Previews: render option thumbnails, summary view, and a printable/exportable decision pack.
  - Automation hooks: when published, trigger reminders and exportable decision logs.
- UX: Progressive disclosure, strong visual hierarchy, status indicators, and contextual help. Consistent with the design system (cards, typography, spacing, color use).

4) Project Workspace Page
- Purpose: Provide a project-level workspace that lists decisions, project files, team members, templates, and project overview (branding and settings).
- Features:
  - Branding: project-specific logos, color tokens, and header branding.
  - Tabs/Sections: Decisions, Files, Team, Templates, Overview/Settings.
  - Decision overview: quick stats (open decisions, overdue, average cycle time), search, and filters.
  - Files: integrated file manager or link to repository, with versioning and quick-glance metadata.
  - Team: members, roles, invite controls, and activity feed.
  - Templates: access to Decision Templates Library with publishable templates for project scope.
- UX: Cohesive, modular cards and panels; responsive layout; consistent navigation and micro-interactions.

=== TASK ===
# Decision Templates Library

## Overview
This prompt instructs an AI development tool to build the Decision Templates Library for Archject, a focused approval and decision-tracking solution for design projects. The system will provide opinionated, reusable templates for common decision types (finishes, layouts, change requests) to accelerate decision creation, paired with a robust Decisions List / Content Browser, a multi-step Create/Edit Decision Page, and a Project Workspace Page. The deliverables enable canonical decision management, visual side-by-side option comparisons, automated reminders, and policy-driven approvals, all within Archject’s branding and design system.

## Components to Build
1) Decision Templates Library (opinionated templates)
- Purpose: Define reusable decision templates for common decision types (e.g., finishes, layouts, change requests) with predefined metadata, required fields, default approval rules, and option sets.
- Data model: Template with fields for name, type, description, required metadata, option schemas (images, specs, layouts), default approval rules, versioning, usage analytics.
- APIs: CRUD for templates (workspace admins and shared/public templates), apply-template to prepopulate decision flow, analytics hooks (usage counts, last-used, success rate).
- UX considerations: Template catalog with search, categories, preview of template structure, “Apply Template” action that preloads the Create Decision flow with template defaults, audit trail of template usage.

2) Decisions List / Content Browser
- Purpose: Canonical list of all decisions across a project with robust filtering, sortable views, and quick previews. Bulk actions include share links, export, and status changes.
- Data model: Decision objects linked to projects, with fields for metadata, status, assignees, due dates, options, version, and audit trail.
- Features:
  - Filters: by status, type, assignee, due date, priority, template used, creation date, tags, and custom facets.
  - Bulk actions: share link generation, export (CSV/JSON/PDF), bulk status updates, bulk assignee changes, bulk export of decision packs.
  - Quick preview: inline panel with summary cards, key options, and a one-click open to full editor.
  - Sorting and views: list, card, and table views; saved filters and recently viewed.
  - Permissions: workspace admins and project members with appropriate read/write controls.
- UX: Card layouts with status badges, option thumbnails, and flow indicators; large tap targets; keyboard accessible controls.

3) Create / Edit Decision Page (Multi-step Editor)
- Purpose: Create or edit a Decision Object via a guided, multi-step flow.
- Steps (modular, collapsible):
  1) Metadata: title, decision type (from templates or custom), project association, category, priority, due date, tags.
  2) Options Upload: upload and manage options (images, specifications, layouts, CAD exports); drag-and-drop uploader; validation for file types and max sizes; thumbnails; option-level metadata.
  3) Side-by-Side Comparison Setup: define groups/columns, align options, compare trade-offs with visual diff of materials, finishes, costs; allow users to mark favored options.
  4) Approval Rules: define approvers, approval workflow stages, required sign-offs, escalation policies, conditional rules.
  5) Assignee & Schedule: assign owner, set reminders (email, in-app, calendar), due date, and escalation notifications.
  6) Review & Publish: summary, validation, generate shareable link, archive/clone, or finalize decision with timestamped approval.
- Features:
  - Real-time collaboration-friendly editor with change tracking and comments per step.
  - Validation: required fields per decision type, file-size limits, and approval rule consistency.
  - Previews: render option thumbnails, summary view, and a printable/exportable decision pack.
  - Automation hooks: when published, trigger reminders and exportable decision logs.
- UX: Progressive disclosure, strong visual hierarchy, status indicators, and contextual help. Consistent with the design system (cards, typography, spacing, color use).

4) Project Workspace Page
- Purpose: Provide a project-level workspace that lists decisions, project files, team members, templates, and project overview (branding and settings).
- Features:
  - Branding: project-specific logos, color tokens, and header branding.
  - Tabs/Sections: Decisions, Files, Team, Templates, Overview/Settings.
  - Decision overview: quick stats (open decisions, overdue, average cycle time), search, and filters.
  - Files: integrated file manager or link to repository, with versioning and quick-glance metadata.
  - Team: members, roles, invite controls, and activity feed.
  - Templates: access to Decision Templates Library with publishable templates for project scope.
- UX: Cohesive, modular cards and panels; responsive layout; consistent navigation and micro-interactions.

  4) User customizes metadata, uploads or edits options, configures approval steps, assigns owners, and sets reminders.
  5) User saves as draft or publishes; analytics event logs the template usage.
- Decisions List navigation:
  1) User navigates to Decisions List / Content Browser.
  2) Applies filters (status, type, assignee, due date, template used) and chooses a view (list/table/card).
  3) User selects multiple decisions for bulk actions (share link, export, change status, assign).
  4) Quick Preview on hover/click shows key details and option thumbnails; can open full editor for a selected item.
- Create/Edit Decision Page flow:
  1) User either starts a new decision or edits an existing one.
  2) Steps guide through metadata, options, side-by-side comparison, approvals, and reminders.
  3) User can toggle back to previous steps, add comments, and see validation errors in real-time.
  4) On publish, a decision log is created, reminders scheduled, and a shareable link is generated if requested.
- Project Workspace Page flow:
  1) User lands on the project workspace; branding header is shown.
  2) User views the Decisions tab, which lists decisions and provides quick analytics.
