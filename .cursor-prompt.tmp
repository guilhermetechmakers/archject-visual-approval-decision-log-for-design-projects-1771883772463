# Modern Design Best Practices

## Philosophy

Create unique, memorable experiences while maintaining consistency through modern design principles. Every project should feel distinct yet professional, innovative yet intuitive.

---

## Landing Pages & Marketing Sites

### Hero Sections
**Go beyond static backgrounds:**
- Animated gradients with subtle movement
- Particle systems or geometric shapes floating
- Interactive canvas backgrounds (Three.js, WebGL)
- Video backgrounds with proper fallbacks
- Parallax scrolling effects
- Gradient mesh animations
- Morphing blob animations


### Layout Patterns
**Use modern grid systems:**
- Bento grids (asymmetric card layouts)
- Masonry layouts for varied content
- Feature sections with diagonal cuts or curves
- Overlapping elements with proper z-index
- Split-screen designs with scroll-triggered reveals

**Avoid:** Traditional 3-column equal grids

### Scroll Animations
**Engage users as they scroll:**
- Fade-in and slide-up animations for sections
- Scroll-triggered parallax effects
- Progress indicators for long pages
- Sticky elements that transform on scroll
- Horizontal scroll sections for portfolios
- Text reveal animations (word by word, letter by letter)
- Number counters animating into view

**Avoid:** Static pages with no scroll interaction

### Call-to-Action Areas
**Make CTAs impossible to miss:**
- Gradient buttons with hover effects
- Floating action buttons with micro-interactions
- Animated borders or glowing effects
- Scale/lift on hover
- Interactive elements that respond to mouse position
- Pulsing indicators for primary actions

---

## Dashboard Applications

### Layout Structure
**Always use collapsible side navigation:**
- Sidebar that can collapse to icons only
- Smooth transition animations between states
- Persistent navigation state (remember user preference)
- Mobile: drawer that slides in/out
- Desktop: sidebar with expand/collapse toggle
- Icons visible even when collapsed

**Structure:**
```
/dashboard (layout wrapper with sidebar)
  /dashboard/overview
  /dashboard/analytics
  /dashboard/settings
  /dashboard/users
  /dashboard/projects
```

All dashboard pages should be nested inside the dashboard layout, not separate routes.

### Data Tables
**Modern table design:**
- Sticky headers on scroll
- Row hover states with subtle elevation
- Sortable columns with clear indicators
- Pagination with items-per-page control
- Search/filter with instant feedback
- Selection checkboxes with bulk actions
- Responsive: cards on mobile, table on desktop
- Loading skeletons, not spinners
- Empty states with illustrations or helpful text

**Use modern table libraries:**
- TanStack Table (React Table v8)
- AG Grid for complex data
- Data Grid from MUI (if using MUI)

### Charts & Visualizations
**Use the latest charting libraries:**
- Recharts (for React, simple charts)
- Chart.js v4 (versatile, well-maintained)
- Apache ECharts (advanced, interactive)
- D3.js (custom, complex visualizations)
- Tremor (for dashboards, built on Recharts)

**Chart best practices:**
- Animated transitions when data changes
- Interactive tooltips with detailed info
- Responsive sizing
- Color scheme matching design system
- Legend placement that doesn't obstruct data
- Loading states while fetching data

### Dashboard Cards
**Metric cards should stand out:**
- Gradient backgrounds or colored accents
- Trend indicators (↑ ↓ with color coding)
- Sparkline charts for historical data
- Hover effects revealing more detail
- Icon representing the metric
- Comparison to previous period

---

## Color & Visual Design

### Color Palettes
**Create depth with gradients:**
- Primary gradient (not just solid primary color)
- Subtle background gradients
- Gradient text for headings
- Gradient borders on cards
- Elevated surfaces for depth

**Color usage:**
- 60-30-10 rule (dominant, secondary, accent)
- Consistent semantic colors (success, warning, error)
- Accessible contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum)

### Typography
**Create hierarchy through contrast:**
- Large, bold headings (48-72px for heroes)
- Clear size differences between levels
- Variable font weights (300, 400, 600, 700)
- Letter spacing for small caps
- Line height 1.5-1.7 for body text
- Inter, Poppins, or DM Sans for modern feel

### Shadows & Depth
**Layer UI elements:**
- Multi-layer shadows for realistic depth
- Colored shadows matching element color
- Elevated states on hover
- Neumorphism for special elements (sparingly)

---

## Interactions & Micro-animations

### Button Interactions
**Every button should react:**
- Scale slightly on hover (1.02-1.05)
- Lift with shadow on hover
- Ripple effect on click
- Loading state with spinner or progress
- Disabled state clearly visible
- Success state with checkmark animation

### Card Interactions
**Make cards feel alive:**
- Lift on hover with increased shadow
- Subtle border glow on hover
- Tilt effect following mouse (3D transform)
- Smooth transitions (200-300ms)
- Click feedback for interactive cards

### Form Interactions
**Guide users through forms:**
- Input focus states with border color change
- Floating labels that animate up
- Real-time validation with inline messages
- Success checkmarks for valid inputs
- Error states with shake animation
- Password strength indicators
- Character count for text areas

### Page Transitions
**Smooth between views:**
- Fade + slide for page changes
- Skeleton loaders during data fetch
- Optimistic UI updates
- Stagger animations for lists
- Route transition animations

---

## Mobile Responsiveness

### Mobile-First Approach
**Design for mobile, enhance for desktop:**
- Touch targets minimum 44x44px
- Generous padding and spacing
- Sticky bottom navigation on mobile
- Collapsible sections for long content
- Swipeable cards and galleries
- Pull-to-refresh where appropriate

### Responsive Patterns
**Adapt layouts intelligently:**
- Hamburger menu → full nav bar
- Card grid → stack on mobile
- Sidebar → drawer
- Multi-column → single column
- Data tables → card list
- Hide/show elements based on viewport

---

## Loading & Empty States

### Loading States
**Never leave users wondering:**
- Skeleton screens matching content layout
- Progress bars for known durations
- Animated placeholders
- Spinners only for short waits (<3s)
- Stagger loading for multiple elements
- Shimmer effects on skeletons

### Empty States
**Make empty states helpful:**
- Illustrations or icons
- Helpful copy explaining why it's empty
- Clear CTA to add first item
- Examples or suggestions
- No "no data" text alone

---

## Unique Elements to Stand Out

### Distinctive Features
**Add personality:**
- Custom cursor effects on landing pages
- Animated page numbers or section indicators
- Unusual hover effects (magnification, distortion)
- Custom scrollbars
- Glassmorphism for overlays
- Animated SVG icons
- Typewriter effects for hero text
- Confetti or celebration animations for actions

### Interactive Elements
**Engage users:**
- Drag-and-drop interfaces
- Sliders and range controls
- Toggle switches with animations
- Progress steps with animations
- Expandable/collapsible sections
- Tabs with slide indicators
- Image comparison sliders
- Interactive demos or playgrounds

---

 for bestpractices and # About / Help & Documentation

## Overview
Create a responsive, accessible, and visually cohesive Help & Documentation hub named “About / Help & Documentation” for Archject. This page acts as the support hub, aggregating product documentation, onboarding guides, an FAQ, a knowledge base with search, a contact form for support, and a changelog / release notes section. The UI should be clean, minimal, and trust-building, with clear navigation, strong typography, and accessible interactions. No external API integrations are required for this task.

## Page Description (Full Detail)
What this page is:
- A centralized Help & Documentation hub that supports users through onboarding, self-service knowledge, and a direct line to human support. It consolidates content into clearly defined sections: Getting Started / Onboarding, Knowledge Base (Search + Article List), FAQ (grouped by topic), Onboarding Guides, Changelog / Release Notes, and a Contact Support form.

Goals:
- Help users quickly find documentation and guidance.
- Provide an intuitive onboarding flow with a Getting Started guide and a checklist.
- Present FAQs grouped by topic with expandable items.
- Enable robust search across knowledge base articles with filters and relevance.
- Allow users to contact support with structured priority and optional attachments.
- Display recent changelog / release notes to showcase product updates.
- Maintain brand consistency with Archject’s design system and color language.
- Ensure accessibility (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, readable contrast).

Connected features:
- Knowledge Base Search: search box, article listing, category/tacet filtering.
- Onboarding Guides: step-by-step guide with checklist, progress tracking.
- FAQ: categorized by topics (sharing, exports, billing) with expandable Q&A items.
- Contact Support Form: subject, description, priority, attachment upload, and submission status.
- Changelog & Release Notes: list of recent updates with dates and brief summaries.
- Visual guidance is aligned with the provided design system: cards, tabs/pills, subtle shadows, typography, and responsive behavior.

UI elements and how they should look:
- Getting Started Guide: a card-based guide with a clear step-by-step flow, checklist status (completed/pending), and the ability to mark steps as complete.
- FAQ: grouped by topic with collapsible accordions; each item shows a question and expands to reveal the answer; quick search within FAQ.
- Knowledge Base: search box at the top, optional filters (category, recency, popularity); article list with titles, short excerpts, and tags; clicking an article opens a detailed view (modal or route to article page).
- Knowledge Base Search: prominent search input with autosuggest or recent searches; results list with snippet previews.
- Contact Support Form: form fields for subject, description, priority (low/medium/high), file attachment (drag-and-drop or browse); confirmation screen after submission; success/failure messages.
- Changelog & Release Notes: a chronological list with date, version, and brief notes; ability to expand to read full notes; highlight most recent updates.

Visual guidance:
- Use the provided color palette and typography guidelines.
- Cards with white backgrounds, subtle shadows, rounded corners, generous internal padding.
- Navigation: top pill-shaped tabs for main sections; left sidebar optional (for large screens) with active state emphasis.
- Data visuals: if included (e.g., status badges) use the accent colors to indicate status.
- Micro-interactions: hover states on cards, focus rings on interactive elements, smooth transitions for accordions and form submissions.

API integrations:
- No APIs connected for this task. Build the frontend structure and data models; mocks or static data can be used for development.

PROJECT CONTEXT:
Archject — Visual Approval & Decision Log for Design Projects
The Help & Documentation hub should reflect Archject’s minimalist, professional aesthetic, with a focus on clarity, ease of use, and a frictionless client-facing experience. The page should feel aligned with Archject’s mission: a trusted, centralized source of truth for decisions and documentation.

Visual Style (reiterated for emphasis):
- Color Palette, Typography, Card Design, Navigation, Data Visualization, Interactive Elements, and Design Philosophy as provided in the prompt.

## Implementation Requirements

### Frontend
- Build a responsive SPA page with a tabbed navigation system (Getting Started, Knowledge Base, FAQ, Onboarding Guides, Changelog, Contact Support).
- Use a component library or design system consistent with the given visuals (cards, pills, accordions, forms, badges, tables if needed).
- Implement:
  - Card component with white background, subtle shadow, rounded corners (12-16px).
  - Top navigation: pill-shaped tabs with active state in #195C4A and white text.
  - Search component with clear button and focus states; suggestion dropdown (static/mocked data).
  - Onboarding checklist: interactive step items with complete state toggling.
  - Knowledge Base: search results with infinite-like paging (mocked); article view modal or page.
  - FAQ: accordion items with animated open/close.
  - Changelog: expandable notes per version.
  - Contact Support: form with validation, file input, and submission handler (mocked).
- State management: use a centralized store (Context API or lightweight state library) to manage tab selection, search queries, and user interactions within the hub.
- Data handling: use static JSON data structures representing articles, FAQs, guides, and changelog for development; ensure the UI is wired to data shapes.
- Validation: form input validation with real-time feedback (required fields, max lengths, valid attachments).
- Accessibility: all interactive controls keyboard-accessible; aria-labels; color contrast checks; focus styles.

### Backend
- Not required to implement real backend APIs for this task. Provide clearly defined data models and endpoints (mocked in frontend or via local mocks) to simulate:
  - GET /help/getting-started
  - GET /help/knowledge-base
  - GET /help/faqs
  - GET /help/onboarding-guides
  - GET /help/changelog
  - POST /help/contact-support
- Data storage: use in-memory or static JSON data representing:
  - Articles (id, title, category, content, tags, date)
  - FAQs (id, category, question, answer)
  - Guides (id, title, steps, progress)
  - Changelog (version, date, notes)
  - Support tickets (mock persistence)
- Validation layer: ensure input validation mirrors frontend rules when mocked API is invoked.

### Integration
- Connect the frontend components to the mocked data layer:
  - Knowledge Base search filters should query articles by title/content/t tags.
  - FAQ accordions should filter by topic.
  - Onboarding guides should reflect step completion state in the UI.
  - Contact Support should simulate submission and render a success message.
- Ensure components are decoupled and reusable:
  - A general Card component, Button component, Input components, and Accordion component should be reusable across sections.
- Ensure routing or in-page tab switching updates URL state if feasible (hash-based routing or query params) for deep linking.

---

=== TASK ===
# About / Help & Documentation

## Overview
Create a responsive, accessible, and visually cohesive Help & Documentation hub named “About / Help & Documentation” for Archject. This page acts as the support hub, aggregating product documentation, onboarding guides, an FAQ, a knowledge base with search, a contact form for support, and a changelog / release notes section. The UI should be clean, minimal, and trust-building, with clear navigation, strong typography, and accessible interactions. No external API integrations are required for this task.

## Page Description (Full Detail)
What this page is:
- A centralized Help & Documentation hub that supports users through onboarding, self-service knowledge, and a direct line to human support. It consolidates content into clearly defined sections: Getting Started / Onboarding, Knowledge Base (Search + Article List), FAQ (grouped by topic), Onboarding Guides, Changelog / Release Notes, and a Contact Support form.

Goals:
- Help users quickly find documentation and guidance.
- Provide an intuitive onboarding flow with a Getting Started guide and a checklist.
- Present FAQs grouped by topic with expandable items.
- Enable robust search across knowledge base articles with filters and relevance.
- Allow users to contact support with structured priority and optional attachments.
- Display recent changelog / release notes to showcase product updates.
- Maintain brand consistency with Archject’s design system and color language.
- Ensure accessibility (ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, readable contrast).

Connected features:
- Knowledge Base Search: search box, article listing, category/tacet filtering.
- Onboarding Guides: step-by-step guide with checklist, progress tracking.
- FAQ: categorized by topics (sharing, exports, billing) with expandable Q&A items.
- Contact Support Form: subject, description, priority, attachment upload, and submission status.
- Changelog & Release Notes: list of recent updates with dates and brief summaries.
- Visual guidance is aligned with the provided design system: cards, tabs/pills, subtle shadows, typography, and responsive behavior.

UI elements and how they should look:
- Getting Started Guide: a card-based guide with a clear step-by-step flow, checklist status (completed/pending), and the ability to mark steps as complete.
- FAQ: grouped by topic with collapsible accordions; each item shows a question and expands to reveal the answer; quick search within FAQ.
- Knowledge Base: search box at the top, optional filters (category, recency, popularity); article list with titles, short excerpts, and tags; clicking an article opens a detailed view (modal or route to article page).
- Knowledge Base Search: prominent search input with autosuggest or recent searches; results list with snippet previews.
- Contact Support Form: form fields for subject, description, priority (low/medium/high), file attachment (drag-and-drop or browse); confirmation screen after submission; success/failure messages.
- Changelog & Release Notes: a chronological list with date, version, and brief notes; ability to expand to read full notes; highlight most recent updates.

Visual guidance:
- Use the provided color palette and typography guidelines.
- Cards with white backgrounds, subtle shadows, rounded corners, generous internal padding.
- Navigation: top pill-shaped tabs for main sections; left sidebar optional (for large screens) with active state emphasis.
- Data visuals: if included (e.g., status badges) use the accent colors to indicate status.
- Micro-interactions: hover states on cards, focus rings on interactive elements, smooth transitions for accordions and form submissions.

API integrations:
- No APIs connected for this task. Build the frontend structure and data models; mocks or static data can be used for development.

PROJECT CONTEXT:
Archject — Visual Approval & Decision Log for Design Projects
The Help & Documentation hub should reflect Archject’s minimalist, professional aesthetic, with a focus on clarity, ease of use, and a frictionless client-facing experience. The page should feel aligned with Archject’s mission: a trusted, centralized source of truth for decisions and documentation.

Visual Style (reiterated for emphasis):
- Color Palette, Typography, Card Design, Navigation, Data Visualization, Interactive Elements, and Design Philosophy as provided in the prompt.

## Implementation Requirements

### Frontend
- Build a responsive SPA page with a tabbed navigation system (Getting Started, Knowledge Base, FAQ, Onboarding Guides, Changelog, Contact Support).
- Use a component library or design system consistent with the given visuals (cards, pills, accordions, forms, badges, tables if needed).
- Implement:
  - Card component with white background, subtle shadow, rounded corners (12-16px).
  - Top navigation: pill-shaped tabs with active state in #195C4A and white text.
  - Search component with clear button and focus states; suggestion dropdown (static/mocked data).
  - Onboarding checklist: interactive step items with complete state toggling.
  - Knowledge Base: search results with infinite-like paging (mocked); article view modal or page.
  - FAQ: accordion items with animated open/close.
  - Changelog: expandable notes per version.
  - Contact Support: form with validation, file input, and submission handler (mocked).
- State management: use a centralized store (Context API or lightweight state library) to manage tab selection, search queries, and user interactions within the hub.
- Data handling: use static JSON data structures representing articles, FAQs, guides, and changelog for development; ensure the UI is wired to data shapes.
- Validation: form input validation with real-time feedback (required fields, max lengths, valid attachments).
- Accessibility: all interactive controls keyboard-accessible; aria-labels; color contrast checks; focus styles.

### Backend
- Not required to implement real backend APIs for this task. Provide clearly defined data models and endpoints (mocked in frontend or via local mocks) to simulate:
  - GET /help/getting-started
  - GET /help/knowledge-base
  - GET /help/faqs
  - GET /help/onboarding-guides
  - GET /help/changelog
  - POST /help/contact-support
- Data storage: use in-memory or static JSON data representing:
  - Articles (id, title, category, content, tags, date)
  - FAQs (id, category, question, answer)
  - Guides (id, title, steps, progress)
  - Changelog (version, date, notes)
  - Support tickets (mock persistence)
- Validation layer: ensure input validation mirrors frontend rules when mocked API is invoked.

### Integration
- Connect the frontend components to the mocked data layer:
  - Knowledge Base search filters should query articles by title/content/t tags.
  - FAQ accordions should filter by topic.
  - Onboarding guides should reflect step completion state in the UI.
  - Contact Support should simulate submission and render a success message.
- Ensure components are decoupled and reusable:
  - A general Card component, Button component, Input components, and Accordion component should be reusable across sections.
- Ensure routing or in-page tab switching updates URL state if feasible (hash-based routing or query params) for deep linking.
