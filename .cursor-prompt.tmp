- Icons visible even when collapsed

**Structure:**
```
/dashboard (layout wrapper with sidebar)
  /dashboard/overview
  /dashboard/analytics
  /dashboard/settings
  /dashboard/users
  /dashboard/projects
```

All dashboard pages should be nested inside the dashboard layout, not separate routes.

 for bestpractices and # Decision Objects CRUD

## Overview
Develop a complete, production-ready module for Decision Objects in Archject. This includes Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) capabilities for Decision Objects, along with associated entities such as options, metadata, approvals, comments, attachments, and lifecycle state transitions (draft, pending, approved, rejected). Build a cohesive set of pages for internal users and project teams: a detailed internal Decision view, a canonical Decisions List Content Browser, a multi-step Create/Edit Decision Page, and a Manage/Edit Decision Page with history and versioning. Ensure data integrity with a normalized PostgreSQL schema, a robust state machine with audit logs, optimistic concurrency control, autosave for drafts, server-side validation, and secure, scalable APIs. Align UI with the Archject design system and accessibility standards, delivering an end-to-end flow from creation to formal approval, storage, and export.

## Components to Build
- Decision Objects CRUD API
  - Core entities: Decision, Option, Metadata, Approval, Comment, Attachment, History/Version, ShareLink, Assignee, Reminders.
  - State machine for Decision lifecycle: Draft -> Pending -> Approved; Pending -> Rejected; with guards and audit trails.
  - Optimistic locking/versioning to prevent edit conflicts.
  - Autosave drafts with autosave indicators and server-side validation.
  - Export capabilities (PDF/JSON/Decision Log) and share link generation with revocation.
- Page: Decision Detail (Internal)
  - Detailed view for internal users.
  - Show decision summary, all options, side-by-side comparison, annotations, approval history, and admin actions (edit, revoke approval, export, reissue link).
  - Inline editing controls for authorized roles; action log with timestamps.
- Page: Decisions List / Content Browser
  - Canonical list of all decisions across a project.
  - Robust, faceted filters (status, assignee, last updated, project, date range, tags, metadata keys/values).
  - Bulk actions: share links, export, change status, delete (soft delete with audit).
  - Quick preview panel or in-row previews for rapid scanning.
- Page: Create / Edit Decision Page
  - Multi-step editor workflow:
    - Step 1: Metadata (title, description, project, tags, due date, priority).
    - Step 2: Options Upload (images, specs, layouts; support bulk uploads, drag-and-drop, versioned attachments).
    - Step 3: Side-by-Side Comparison Setup (define visible comparison fields, layout presets, option weights).
    - Step 4: Approval Rules (who can approve, required approvals, escalation, deadlines).
    - Step 5: Assignee & Schedule Reminders (assign to team member, client liaison, reminder cadence, notifications).
  - Autosave drafts, real-time validation, and auto-suggestion of metadata defaults from project templates.
- Page: Edit / Manage Decision Page
  - Detailed editing with:
    - History & Version Compare (view diffs between versions, rollback).
    - Reissue Share Link (grant new share URL with expiration, revoke old ones).
    - Fine-grained permissions per decision (view/edit/approve).
    - Attachments/versioned assets and re-upload workflow.
  - Conflict detection and merge hints when concurrent edits occur.

## Implementation Requirements

### Frontend
- UI Components
  - Card system matching design tokens (spacing, typography, elevation).
  - Data tables with server-side pagination, sorting, and filtering.
  - Multi-step form wizard with progress indicator, save/continue, and autosave state.
  - Side-by-side comparison panel with resizable columns and synchronized scrolling.
  - Rich text/annotation area for comments and notes.
  - Status chips and indicators (Draft, Pending, Approved, Rejected) with color coding.
  - Bulk action toolbar with selection checkboxes, confirm dialogs, and undo/redo where appropriate.
  - Admin action dock (edit, revoke approval, export, share link management).
  - Export/download widgets for PDFs/JSON/Decision Logs.
  - Attachment uploader supporting drag-and-drop, progress indicators, and version history.
  - Notification toasts for success/failure, with actionable steps.
  - Real-time cues for optimistic concurrency (lock indicators, warning on conflicts).
- Accessibility
  - Keyboard navigable, proper ARIA labels, and screen reader-friendly roles.
  - Focus rings and high-contrast states for critical actions.
- State Management
  - Use a modern framework (React preferred) with either Redux Toolkit or equivalent context-based state management.
  - Centralized API layer with retry logic, and optimistic updates for create/update/delete operations.

### Backend

  - Reminder: id, decision_id, remind_at, method (email/slack), status.
- API Layer
  - Endpoints for CRUD on Decision and related entities.
  - State machine endpoints to advance transitions with guards (e.g., canApprove, canReject).
  - Version control endpoints: fetch version diffs, compare, rollback.
  - Autosave endpoint for draft persistence.
  - Attachments upload/download endpoints with secure presigned upload URLs.
  - Export endpoints: generate printable PDFs, JSON export, and a consolidated Decision Log.
- Validation & Guards
  - Server-side validation for required fields, metadata schemas, and attachment types.
  - Concurrency control via optimistic locking (version field on Decision).
  - Transition guards based on user roles, current state, and approvals.
- Security & Authorization
  - Role-based access control (RBC) with roles: Viewer, Editor, Approver, Admin.
  - Per-decision permissions for sensitive actions (edit, approve, export, share).
  - JWT-based authentication; refresh tokens; short-lived access tokens for file downloads.
  - Input validation, CSRF protection for state-changing endpoints.
- Performance & Reliability
  - Efficient queries with proper indexing (decision_id, project_id, status, version, timestamps).

- Editors: create/update decisions, add options, metadata, comments.
- Approvers: approve/reject, manage approvals.
- Admins: full access including share links, exports, history, and deletion.

Validation:
- Server-side validation for required fields, unique titles within a project (optional), valid statuses, valid version numbers.
- Verify upload file types and sizes; reject disallowed formats.
- Enforce transition guards (e.g., cannot approve a decision in DRAFT state).

Optimistic Locking:
- Each Decision has a version. Clients must supply current version to update; conflict results in a 409 CONFLICT with a diff hint.

Autosave:
- Endpoint supports draft autosave; client-side should save a draft version at intervals (e.g., every 60 seconds) and on field changes.

Integration:
- Event bus or webhook system to notify external services on approvals, status changes, or exports.
- Real-time updates via WebSocket or long polling for collaborators viewing the same decision.

# Decision Objects CRUD

## Overview
Develop a complete, production-ready module for Decision Objects in Archject. This includes Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) capabilities for Decision Objects, along with associated entities such as options, metadata, approvals, comments, attachments, and lifecycle state transitions (draft, pending, approved, rejected). Build a cohesive set of pages for internal users and project teams: a detailed internal Decision view, a canonical Decisions List Content Browser, a multi-step Create/Edit Decision Page, and a Manage/Edit Decision Page with history and versioning. Ensure data integrity with a normalized PostgreSQL schema, a robust state machine with audit logs, optimistic concurrency control, autosave for drafts, server-side validation, and secure, scalable APIs. Align UI with the Archject design system and accessibility standards, delivering an end-to-end flow from creation to formal approval, storage, and export.

## Components to Build
- Decision Objects CRUD API
  - Core entities: Decision, Option, Metadata, Approval, Comment, Attachment, History/Version, ShareLink, Assignee, Reminders.
  - State machine for Decision lifecycle: Draft -> Pending -> Approved; Pending -> Rejected; with guards and audit trails.
  - Optimistic locking/versioning to prevent edit conflicts.
  - Autosave drafts with autosave indicators and server-side validation.
  - Export capabilities (PDF/JSON/Decision Log) and share link generation with revocation.
- Page: Decision Detail (Internal)
  - Detailed view for internal users.
  - Show decision summary, all options, side-by-side comparison, annotations, approval history, and admin actions (edit, revoke approval, export, reissue link).
  - Inline editing controls for authorized roles; action log with timestamps.
- Page: Decisions List / Content Browser
  - Canonical list of all decisions across a project.
  - Robust, faceted filters (status, assignee, last updated, project, date range, tags, metadata keys/values).
  - Bulk actions: share links, export, change status, delete (soft delete with audit).
  - Quick preview panel or in-row previews for rapid scanning.
- Page: Create / Edit Decision Page
  - Multi-step editor workflow:
    - Step 1: Metadata (title, description, project, tags, due date, priority).
    - Step 2: Options Upload (images, specs, layouts; support bulk uploads, drag-and-drop, versioned attachments).
    - Step 3: Side-by-Side Comparison Setup (define visible comparison fields, layout presets, option weights).
    - Step 4: Approval Rules (who can approve, required approvals, escalation, deadlines).
    - Step 5: Assignee & Schedule Reminders (assign to team member, client liaison, reminder cadence, notifications).
  - Autosave drafts, real-time validation, and auto-suggestion of metadata defaults from project templates.
- Page: Edit / Manage Decision Page
  - Detailed editing with:
    - History & Version Compare (view diffs between versions, rollback).
    - Reissue Share Link (grant new share URL with expiration, revoke old ones).
    - Fine-grained permissions per decision (view/edit/approve).
    - Attachments/versioned assets and re-upload workflow.
  - Conflict detection and merge hints when concurrent edits occur.

## Implementation Requirements

### Frontend

  - Card system matching design tokens (spacing, typography, elevation).
  - Data tables with server-side pagination, sorting, and filtering.
  - Multi-step form wizard with progress indicator, save/continue, and autosave state.
  - Side-by-side comparison panel with resizable columns and synchronized scrolling.
  - Rich text/annotation area for comments and notes.
  - Status chips and indicators (Draft, Pending, Approved, Rejected) with color coding.
  - Bulk action toolbar with selection checkboxes, confirm dialogs, and undo/redo where appropriate.
  - Admin action dock (edit, revoke approval, export, share link management).
