# Modern Design Best Practices

## Philosophy

Create unique, memorable experiences while maintaining consistency through modern design principles. Every project should feel distinct yet professional, innovative yet intuitive.

---

## Landing Pages & Marketing Sites

### Hero Sections
**Go beyond static backgrounds:**
- Animated gradients with subtle movement
- Particle systems or geometric shapes floating
- Interactive canvas backgrounds (Three.js, WebGL)
- Video backgrounds with proper fallbacks
- Parallax scrolling effects
- Gradient mesh animations
- Morphing blob animations


### Layout Patterns
**Use modern grid systems:**
- Bento grids (asymmetric card layouts)
- Masonry layouts for varied content
- Feature sections with diagonal cuts or curves
- Overlapping elements with proper z-index
- Split-screen designs with scroll-triggered reveals

**Avoid:** Traditional 3-column equal grids

### Scroll Animations
**Engage users as they scroll:**
- Fade-in and slide-up animations for sections
- Scroll-triggered parallax effects
- Progress indicators for long pages
- Sticky elements that transform on scroll
- Horizontal scroll sections for portfolios
- Text reveal animations (word by word, letter by letter)
- Number counters animating into view

**Avoid:** Static pages with no scroll interaction

### Call-to-Action Areas
**Make CTAs impossible to miss:**
- Gradient buttons with hover effects
- Floating action buttons with micro-interactions
- Animated borders or glowing effects
- Scale/lift on hover
- Interactive elements that respond to mouse position
- Pulsing indicators for primary actions

---

## Dashboard Applications

### Layout Structure
**Always use collapsible side navigation:**
- Sidebar that can collapse to icons only
- Smooth transition animations between states
- Persistent navigation state (remember user preference)
- Mobile: drawer that slides in/out
- Desktop: sidebar with expand/collapse toggle
- Icons visible even when collapsed

**Structure:**
```
/dashboard (layout wrapper with sidebar)
  /dashboard/overview
  /dashboard/analytics
  /dashboard/settings
  /dashboard/users
  /dashboard/projects
```

All dashboard pages should be nested inside the dashboard layout, not separate routes.

### Data Tables
**Modern table design:**
- Sticky headers on scroll
- Row hover states with subtle elevation
- Sortable columns with clear indicators
- Pagination with items-per-page control
- Search/filter with instant feedback
- Selection checkboxes with bulk actions
- Responsive: cards on mobile, table on desktop

 for bestpractices and # User Profile Management

## Overview
Build a cohesive User Profile Management system for Archject that enables users to view and edit their account details, manage multiple sessions, configure notification preferences (per-user and per-workspace), and tailor workspace preferences (branding, integrations, API access, and data export). This module powers three associated pages—page_profile, page_settings, and page_dashboard—and must integrate seamlessly with the Archject project context: a design-approval workflow with per-project workspaces, client-facing decision logs, and exportable records. The solution should support CRUD operations with robust validation, secure media uploads (avatar), session management including remote sign-out, and per-workspace scoping of preferences and data.

## Components to Build
- User Profile CRUD
  - View, edit, and validate account details (name, email, role, time zone, locale, avatar)
  - Avatar upload with size/format restrictions (Cloudinary or S3)
  - Password change flow with validation (strength, confirmation)
- Session Management
  - List active sessions (device, IP, last active)
  - Remote sign-out for individual sessions or all sessions
- Notification Preferences
  - Per-user preferences (email, push, in-app)
  - Per-workspace overrides with inheritance from global defaults
  - Notification channels, frequency, and opt-in toggles
- Workspace Preferences
  - Branding: logos, color tokens, header/footer text, custom CSS options
  - Integrations: list/configure third-party integrations (e.g., Slack, Jira, CAD/BIM tools)
  - API Keys: view, generate, revoke, and scoped permissions
  - Data Export: export workspace data (JSON/CSV), request history, and export formats
- Dashboard Page (page_dashboard)
  - Summary of user-specific items: active projects, decisions awaiting client response, recent activity
  - Quick actions: create a decision, share client links
- Settings / Preferences Page (page_settings)
  - Billing info access (subscription status, invoices, plan)
  - Branding settings and workspace data export
  - Notification preferences and integration keys
  - API keys management
  - Workspace data export and export history
- Security & Compliance
  - Validation, rate limiting on sensitive endpoints, audit logs for profile changes
  - Data residency considerations and export/export history

## Implementation Requirements

### Frontend
- Pages and Components
  - page_profile: Profile header with avatar, editable fields, password change, and session management.
  - page_settings: Tabbed or accordion interface containing sections for Billing, Branding, Notifications, Integrations, API Keys, and Data Export.
  - page_dashboard: User-specific dashboard with widgets for projects, decisions, activity feed, and quick actions.
- UI Components
  - AvatarUploader: drag-and-drop or click-to-upload, preview, progress, error states; size limit (e.g., 2–5 MB) and allowed formats (jpeg, png, webp).
  - Field components: Input, Select, Toggle, RadioGroup, TextArea with validation states.
  - Cards: Reusable Card with header, body, and actions; hover states for interactivity.
  - Tabs/Accordion: For Settings sections; accessible keyboard navigation.
  - Tables/Lists: Sessions list, API keys, and export history with sorting and filtering.
  - Badge/Status: Status indicators (online, inactive, needs attention) with color mapping.
  - Button System: Primary (deep green #195C4A), Secondary, and Ghost styles; disabled states and loading indicators.
  - NotificationPreview: Inline previews of notification channel configurations.
  - Data Visualization (optional): Lightweight activity charts (e.g., new logins per day) with minimal dependencies.
- Accessibility & UX
  - Focus management, aria-labels, keyboard navigation, and meaningful error messaging.
  - Responsive layouts: mobile-first with grids that adapt to 12-column system; ensure generous tap targets (44px+).
  - Internationalization: Prepare for i18n (labels as keys, locale-aware formats).

# User Profile Management

## Overview
Build a cohesive User Profile Management system for Archject that enables users to view and edit their account details, manage multiple sessions, configure notification preferences (per-user and per-workspace), and tailor workspace preferences (branding, integrations, API access, and data export). This module powers three associated pages—page_profile, page_settings, and page_dashboard—and must integrate seamlessly with the Archject project context: a design-approval workflow with per-project workspaces, client-facing decision logs, and exportable records. The solution should support CRUD operations with robust validation, secure media uploads (avatar), session management including remote sign-out, and per-workspace scoping of preferences and data.

## Components to Build
- User Profile CRUD
  - View, edit, and validate account details (name, email, role, time zone, locale, avatar)
  - Avatar upload with size/format restrictions (Cloudinary or S3)
  - Password change flow with validation (strength, confirmation)
- Session Management
  - List active sessions (device, IP, last active)
  - Remote sign-out for individual sessions or all sessions
- Notification Preferences
  - Per-user preferences (email, push, in-app)
  - Per-workspace overrides with inheritance from global defaults
  - Notification channels, frequency, and opt-in toggles
- Workspace Preferences
  - Branding: logos, color tokens, header/footer text, custom CSS options
  - Integrations: list/configure third-party integrations (e.g., Slack, Jira, CAD/BIM tools)
  - API Keys: view, generate, revoke, and scoped permissions
  - Data Export: export workspace data (JSON/CSV), request history, and export formats
- Dashboard Page (page_dashboard)
  - Summary of user-specific items: active projects, decisions awaiting client response, recent activity
  - Quick actions: create a decision, share client links
- Settings / Preferences Page (page_settings)
  - Billing info access (subscription status, invoices, plan)
  - Branding settings and workspace data export
  - Notification preferences and integration keys
  - API keys management
  - Workspace data export and export history
- Security & Compliance
  - Validation, rate limiting on sensitive endpoints, audit logs for profile changes
  - Data residency considerations and export/export history

## Implementation Requirements
