- Animated gradients with subtle movement
- Particle systems or geometric shapes floating
- Interactive canvas backgrounds (Three.js, WebGL)
- Video backgrounds with proper fallbacks
- Parallax scrolling effects
- Gradient mesh animations
- Morphing blob animations


### Layout Patterns
**Use modern grid systems:**
- Bento grids (asymmetric card layouts)
- Masonry layouts for varied content
- Feature sections with diagonal cuts or curves
- Overlapping elements with proper z-index
- Split-screen designs with scroll-triggered reveals

**Avoid:** Traditional 3-column equal grids

### Scroll Animations
**Engage users as they scroll:**
- Fade-in and slide-up animations for sections
- Scroll-triggered parallax effects
- Progress indicators for long pages
- Sticky elements that transform on scroll
- Horizontal scroll sections for portfolios
- Text reveal animations (word by word, letter by letter)
- Number counters animating into view

**Avoid:** Static pages with no scroll interaction

### Call-to-Action Areas
**Make CTAs impossible to miss:**
- Gradient buttons with hover effects

- Animated borders or glowing effects
- Scale/lift on hover
- Interactive elements that respond to mouse position
- Pulsing indicators for primary actions

---

## Dashboard Applications

### Layout Structure
**Always use collapsible side navigation:**
- Sidebar that can collapse to icons only
- Smooth transition animations between states
- Persistent navigation state (remember user preference)
- Mobile: drawer that slides in/out
- Desktop: sidebar with expand/collapse toggle
- Icons visible even when collapsed

**Structure:**
```
/dashboard (layout wrapper with sidebar)
  /dashboard/overview
  /dashboard/analytics
  /dashboard/settings
  /dashboard/users
  /dashboard/projects
```

All dashboard pages should be nested inside the dashboard layout, not separate routes.

### Data Tables
**Modern table design:**
- Sticky headers on scroll
- Row hover states with subtle elevation
- Sortable columns with clear indicators
- Pagination with items-per-page control
- Search/filter with instant feedback

  - If log in: verify credentials; on success, issue tokens; load user dashboard
  - OAuth: redirect to Google; on success, map to user/workspace; enforce domain policy if enterprise
- Admin & Observability
  - Admin endpoints protected by admin role checks
  - Health endpoints return heartbeat, DB connection status, queue lengths
  - Logs exposed to admin with export options

## User Experience Flow
- User signs up
  1. User visits auth page and selects Sign up
  2. Enters email, password, confirms password
  3. Enters workspace name; domain is auto-associated or set up via onboarding
