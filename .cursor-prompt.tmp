⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION RULES - READ FIRST ⚠️
❌ NEVER run: npm run dev, npm start, yarn dev, pnpm dev, or ANY development server
❌ NEVER run: long-running processes, servers, or commands that don't exit
❌ NEVER test the application by starting it
✅ ALLOWED: npm install, npm run build, npm run test (if needed)
✅ YOUR TASK: Create/modify files only, then STOP and EXIT immediately
⚠️ The MCP server handles all testing and validation separately

## Landing Pages & Marketing Sites

### Hero Sections
**Go beyond static backgrounds:**
- Animated gradients with subtle movement
- Particle systems or geometric shapes floating
- Interactive canvas backgrounds (Three.js, WebGL)
- Video backgrounds with proper fallbacks
- Parallax scrolling effects
- Gradient mesh animations
- Morphing blob animations


### Layout Patterns
**Use modern grid systems:**
- Bento grids (asymmetric card layouts)
- Masonry layouts for varied content
- Feature sections with diagonal cuts or curves
- Overlapping elements with proper z-index
- Split-screen designs with scroll-triggered reveals

**Avoid:** Traditional 3-column equal grids

### Scroll Animations
**Engage users as they scroll:**
- Fade-in and slide-up animations for sections
- Scroll-triggered parallax effects
- Progress indicators for long pages
- Sticky elements that transform on scroll
- Horizontal scroll sections for portfolios
- Text reveal animations (word by word, letter by letter)
- Number counters animating into view

**Avoid:** Static pages with no scroll interaction

### Call-to-Action Areas
**Make CTAs impossible to miss:**
- Gradient buttons with hover effects

- Animated borders or glowing effects
- Scale/lift on hover
- Interactive elements that respond to mouse position
- Pulsing indicators for primary actions

---

## Dashboard Applications

### Layout Structure
**Always use collapsible side navigation:**
- Sidebar that can collapse to icons only
- Smooth transition animations between states
- Persistent navigation state (remember user preference)
- Mobile: drawer that slides in/out
- Desktop: sidebar with expand/collapse toggle
- Icons visible even when collapsed

**Structure:**
```
/dashboard (layout wrapper with sidebar)
  /dashboard/overview
  /dashboard/analytics
  /dashboard/settings
  /dashboard/users
  /dashboard/projects
```

All dashboard pages should be nested inside the dashboard layout, not separate routes.

### Data Tables
**Modern table design:**
- Sticky headers on scroll
- Row hover states with subtle elevation
- Sortable columns with clear indicators
- Pagination with items-per-page control
- Search/filter with instant feedback
- Selection checkboxes with bulk actions
- Responsive: cards on mobile, table on desktop

  - All 2FA events logged to AuditLog with user_id, action, and metadata
  - Recovery code generation logged as events
- Settings / Preferences Page
  - Page area for 2FA under Settings / Preferences
  - Interactions integrate with existing preferences architecture (shared layout, modals, and toasts)

## User Experience Flow
1. User navigates to Settings / Preferences, then 2FA section
2. If 2FA is disabled:
   - User sees option to Enroll with two sub-options: Authenticator (TOTP) or SMS
   - For TOTP enrollment:
     - User clicks Setup TOTP, backend returns secret and otpauth URL
     - UI renders a QR code and a text secret, plus a Verify button
     - User scans QR with authenticator app and enters 6-digit code
     - System validates; on success, 2FA becomes enabled with method set to TOTP
     - Audit log entry created for enrollment
   - For SMS enrollment:
     - User enters phone number (validated) and requests verification
     - Backend sends OTP via Twilio; UI prompts for code
     - User enters 6-digit code; on success, 2FA enabled with method SMS and phone verified
     - Audit log entry created
   - Recovery codes are generated (one-time display) and shown to user; codes are hashed in storage
3. If 2FA is enabled:
   - UI shows current method and status; option to Disable with confirmation
   - Option to Regenerate recovery codes (requires re-auth)
4. Login-time flow (outside this task scope but integrated):
   - If 2FA is enabled for the account, prompt for TOTP or SMS code depending on the configured method
   - Successful verification completes login; failed attempts are rate-limited and logged
5. On Disable:
   - User confirms disable; backend disables 2FA and logs action
   - UI reflects new status and informs user of consequences
