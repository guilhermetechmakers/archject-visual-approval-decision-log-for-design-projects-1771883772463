# Project-Specific Customizations

**IMPORTANT: This section contains the specific design requirements for THIS project. The guidelines above are universal best practices - these customizations below take precedence for project-specific decisions.**

## User Design Requirements

Client Portal and Internal Decision Detail.
  - Card-based, grid layouts, accessible components, responsive behavior (mobile-first).
  - Inline media annotation tools with zoom/pan, scrubber for media timeline (if applicable).
  - Rich text input with mention suggestions, emoji support optional.

---

## Implementation Requirements

### Frontend
- Build a cohesive design system-aligned UI:
  - Reusable React/Vue/Svelte components (Card, Button, Input, Tag, Tabs, MediaViewer, AnnotationOverlay, CommentThread).
  - MediaAnnotationOverlay component capable of rendering shapes, showing metadata, and allowing edits by authorized users.
  - CommentThread component with nested replies, edit/delete windows, mention highlighting, and inline actions (edit, delete, resolve).
  - Side-by-side OptionComparison component: responsive grid that adapts to viewport; shows media, specs, cost, and decision notes per option.
  - Real-time update indicators (typing, new comments, annotation changes).

- Pages:
  - Client Portal (No-login Link):
    - Route: /client-portal/:decisionToken
    - Features: authentication via token, side-by-side comparison, comment composer with mentions, annotation-capable media, approve/change-request actions, optional OTP flow.
  - Decision Detail (Internal):
    - Route: /internal/decisions/:decisionId
    - Features: full decision data, option-by-option annotations, audit trail, export controls, moderation tools, admin actions.

- Accessibility:
  - ARIA roles, keyboard navigable, proper focus management, readable contrast (WCAG 2.1 AA).

- Internationalization:
  - Prepare for i18n (text keys, date/number localization) if needed.

- Performance:
  - Lazy loading of options/media, pagination for comments, efficient annotation rendering for large media.
  - Debounced input for comment typing, optimistic UI updates.

- Mobile-first considerations:
  - Stacked layout with collapsible sections, touch-friendly controls, and large tap targets.

- Testing:
  - Unit tests for models and services, integration tests for end-to-end comment flow, WebSocket events, and export generation.

### Backend
- Data Models (SQL/NoSQL as appropriate):
  - User: id, name, email, role, preferences.
  - Project: id, name, branding tokens, default settings.
  - Decision: id, project_id, title, status (pending/approved/revoked/needs_changes), created_at, updated_at, approved_by, approved_at, revoked_at.
  - Option: id, decision_id, title, description, media_ids, specs, price, comparison_rank.
  - Media: id, asset_url, type (image/pdf/3d), media_metadata, linked_annotations (array of annotation_ids).
  - Annotation: id, media_id, option_id (nullable), shape_type (point/rect/polygon), coordinates (JSON), created_by, created_at, updated_by, updated_at, note.
  - Comment: id, decision_id, option_id (nullable), parent_id (nullable for threading), author_id, text, mentions (array of user_ids), created_at, updated_at, edited_by, edited_at, status (active/edited/deleted).
  - Notification: id, user_id, type (mention/comment/approval), reference_id, read_at, created_at.
  - ApprovalHistory: id, decision_id, user_id, action (created/approved/rejected/edited), timestamp, details (JSON).
  - Export: id, decision_id, type (pdf/json/csv), generated_at, url.

- APIs (REST or GraphQL):
  - Decisions
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}
    - POST /api/decisions
    - PUT /api/decisions/{id}
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/approve
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/revoke
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}/export
  - Options
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}/options
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/options
  - Media-Annotations
    - POST /api/media/{media_id}/annotations
    - PUT /api/annotations/{id}
    - DELETE /api/annotations/{id}
    - GET /api/media/{media_id}/annotations
  - Comments
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}/comments
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/comments
    - PUT /api/comments/{id}
    - DELETE /api/comments/{id}
  - Mentions & Notifications
    - POST /api/notifications/mention
    - GET /api/notifications?user_id=...
  - Real-time
    - WebSocket channel endpoints for /ws/decisions/{decisionId}
  - Exports
    - GET /api/exports/{export_id}
  - Auth
    - OAuth2 / JWT-based authentication; token validation; role checks.

- Database indexing and constraints:
  - Index on decision_id for comments, annotations; index on media_id; composite indexes for option and decision lookups.
  - Foreign keys: decision -> project; option -> decision; annotation -> media/option; comment -> decision/option/parent; notification -> user.

- Real-time & Messaging:
  - WebSocket channels per decision for comments and annotation updates.
  - Fallback to long-polling if WebSockets unavailable.
  - Debounce rapid comment streams; ensure at-least-once delivery semantics.

- Security:
  - No-login access tokens for client portal with expiration; token rotation.
  - Server-side validation for all inputs; server-side enforcement of business rules (e.g., cannot approve after revoke).
  - Rate limiting on comment POSTs and OTP validation; detect and mitigate abuse.

- Data Integrity & Auditing:
  - Immutable audit entries for approvals and edits; versioning for comments and annotations (with delta diffs if feasible).
  - Export exports reproduce exact state snapshots with timestamps.

### Integration
- Client Portal and Internal Decision Detail both consume the same backend APIs:
  - Shared data models for decisions, options, media, comments, and annotations.
  - Client Portal uses a token-based access path with read/write scoped permissions; Limited comment actions, no admin controls.
  - Internal view uses full permissions (create/edit/delete, export, revoke).

- Branding & Theming:
  - Centralized design tokens for colors, font sizes, spacing, radii.
  - Components should adapt to the brand’s palette and be override-ready for client-specific branding.

- Error Handling:
  - Consistent error payload structure; user-friendly messages; telemetry hooks for errors.

---

## User Experience Flow

1) Client Portal (No-login Link)
- Client opens a shareable link to a decision with side-by-side options.
- Client views media and option details; annotations are visible and can be added by authorized clients if permitted.
- Client adds a comment, optionally mentioning internal team members. Comment appears in real-time or near real-time.
- Client annotates media coordinates to indicate preferences or concerns (where allowed).
- Client can approve or request changes, optionally leaving a short note; action triggers a notification to internal stakeholders.
- If OTP/verification is enabled:
  - Client enters email (if captured) or phone to receive an OTP.
  - Client enters OTP to validate before submitting approval or comments beyond a basic level.
- Notifications: when a new comment or mention appears, the client gets a notification via the chosen channel.

2) Internal Decision Detail (Admin)
- Internal user logs in to /internal/decisions/{decisionId}.
- See the decision overview with status, timestamps, and approval history.
- Open each option to view side-by-side comparisons, related media, and inline annotations.
- View and reply to comments; edit or delete comments within allowed windows; resolve comments if applicable.
- Add annotations to media; modify existing annotations or create new ones; link annotations to specific options if needed.
- Admin actions:
  - Edit decision details, revise option data, or adjust approvals.
  - Revoke approvals with rationale; log revoke reason in ApprovalHistory.
  - Export decision logs to PDF/JSON/CSV; download or share export URL.
- Real-time updates ensure parallel editors see changes instantly.

3) Notifications & Mentions
- Mentions trigger in-app notifications; mention recipients are auto-tagged and alerted.
- Clients and internal users receive notifications about:
  - New comments, replies, or annotations.
  - Status changes (approved, changes requested, revoked).
  - Mentions and upcoming deadlines/reminders.

4) Moderation
- Moderators can edit/delete inappropriate content within allowed windows.
- Moderation logs captured with user and timestamp.

**Never leave users wondering:**
- Skeleton screens matching content layout
- Progress bars for known durations
- Animated placeholders
- Spinners only for short waits (<3s)
- Stagger loading for multiple elements
- Shimmer effects on skeletons

### Empty States
**Make empty states helpful:**
- Illustrations or icons
- Helpful copy explaining why it's empty
- Clear CTA to add first item
- Examples or suggestions
- No "no data" text alone

# Project-Specific Customizations

**IMPORTANT: This section contains the specific design requirements for THIS project. The guidelines above are universal best practices - these customizations below take precedence for project-specific decisions.**

## User Design Requirements

Client Portal and Internal Decision Detail.
  - Card-based, grid layouts, accessible components, responsive behavior (mobile-first).
  - Inline media annotation tools with zoom/pan, scrubber for media timeline (if applicable).
  - Rich text input with mention suggestions, emoji support optional.

---

## Implementation Requirements

### Frontend
- Build a cohesive design system-aligned UI:
  - Reusable React/Vue/Svelte components (Card, Button, Input, Tag, Tabs, MediaViewer, AnnotationOverlay, CommentThread).
  - MediaAnnotationOverlay component capable of rendering shapes, showing metadata, and allowing edits by authorized users.
  - CommentThread component with nested replies, edit/delete windows, mention highlighting, and inline actions (edit, delete, resolve).
  - Side-by-side OptionComparison component: responsive grid that adapts to viewport; shows media, specs, cost, and decision notes per option.
  - Real-time update indicators (typing, new comments, annotation changes).

- Pages:
  - Client Portal (No-login Link):
    - Route: /client-portal/:decisionToken
    - Features: authentication via token, side-by-side comparison, comment composer with mentions, annotation-capable media, approve/change-request actions, optional OTP flow.
  - Decision Detail (Internal):
    - Route: /internal/decisions/:decisionId
    - Features: full decision data, option-by-option annotations, audit trail, export controls, moderation tools, admin actions.

- Accessibility:
  - ARIA roles, keyboard navigable, proper focus management, readable contrast (WCAG 2.1 AA).

- Internationalization:
  - Prepare for i18n (text keys, date/number localization) if needed.

- Performance:
  - Lazy loading of options/media, pagination for comments, efficient annotation rendering for large media.
  - Debounced input for comment typing, optimistic UI updates.

- Mobile-first considerations:
  - Stacked layout with collapsible sections, touch-friendly controls, and large tap targets.

- Testing:
  - Unit tests for models and services, integration tests for end-to-end comment flow, WebSocket events, and export generation.

### Backend
- Data Models (SQL/NoSQL as appropriate):
  - User: id, name, email, role, preferences.
  - Project: id, name, branding tokens, default settings.
  - Decision: id, project_id, title, status (pending/approved/revoked/needs_changes), created_at, updated_at, approved_by, approved_at, revoked_at.
  - Option: id, decision_id, title, description, media_ids, specs, price, comparison_rank.
  - Media: id, asset_url, type (image/pdf/3d), media_metadata, linked_annotations (array of annotation_ids).
  - Annotation: id, media_id, option_id (nullable), shape_type (point/rect/polygon), coordinates (JSON), created_by, created_at, updated_by, updated_at, note.
  - Comment: id, decision_id, option_id (nullable), parent_id (nullable for threading), author_id, text, mentions (array of user_ids), created_at, updated_at, edited_by, edited_at, status (active/edited/deleted).
  - Notification: id, user_id, type (mention/comment/approval), reference_id, read_at, created_at.
  - ApprovalHistory: id, decision_id, user_id, action (created/approved/rejected/edited), timestamp, details (JSON).
  - Export: id, decision_id, type (pdf/json/csv), generated_at, url.

- APIs (REST or GraphQL):
  - Decisions
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}
    - POST /api/decisions
    - PUT /api/decisions/{id}
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/approve
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/revoke
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}/export
  - Options
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}/options
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/options
  - Media-Annotations
    - POST /api/media/{media_id}/annotations
    - PUT /api/annotations/{id}
    - DELETE /api/annotations/{id}
    - GET /api/media/{media_id}/annotations
  - Comments
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}/comments
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/comments
    - PUT /api/comments/{id}
    - DELETE /api/comments/{id}
  - Mentions & Notifications
    - POST /api/notifications/mention
    - GET /api/notifications?user_id=...
  - Real-time
    - WebSocket channel endpoints for /ws/decisions/{decisionId}
  - Exports
    - GET /api/exports/{export_id}
  - Auth
    - OAuth2 / JWT-based authentication; token validation; role checks.

- Database indexing and constraints:
  - Index on decision_id for comments, annotations; index on media_id; composite indexes for option and decision lookups.
  - Foreign keys: decision -> project; option -> decision; annotation -> media/option; comment -> decision/option/parent; notification -> user.

- Real-time & Messaging:
  - WebSocket channels per decision for comments and annotation updates.
  - Fallback to long-polling if WebSockets unavailable.
  - Debounce rapid comment streams; ensure at-least-once delivery semantics.

- Security:
  - No-login access tokens for client portal with expiration; token rotation.
  - Server-side validation for all inputs; server-side enforcement of business rules (e.g., cannot approve after revoke).
  - Rate limiting on comment POSTs and OTP validation; detect and mitigate abuse.

- Data Integrity & Auditing:
  - Immutable audit entries for approvals and edits; versioning for comments and annotations (with delta diffs if feasible).
  - Export exports reproduce exact state snapshots with timestamps.

### Integration
- Client Portal and Internal Decision Detail both consume the same backend APIs:
  - Shared data models for decisions, options, media, comments, and annotations.
  - Client Portal uses a token-based access path with read/write scoped permissions; Limited comment actions, no admin controls.
  - Internal view uses full permissions (create/edit/delete, export, revoke).

- Branding & Theming:
  - Centralized design tokens for colors, font sizes, spacing, radii.
  - Components should adapt to the brand’s palette and be override-ready for client-specific branding.

- Error Handling:
  - Consistent error payload structure; user-friendly messages; telemetry hooks for errors.

---

## User Experience Flow

1) Client Portal (No-login Link)
- Client opens a shareable link to a decision with side-by-side options.
- Client views media and option details; annotations are visible and can be added by authorized clients if permitted.
- Client adds a comment, optionally mentioning internal team members. Comment appears in real-time or near real-time.
- Client annotates media coordinates to indicate preferences or concerns (where allowed).
- Client can approve or request changes, optionally leaving a short note; action triggers a notification to internal stakeholders.
- If OTP/verification is enabled:
  - Client enters email (if captured) or phone to receive an OTP.
  - Client enters OTP to validate before submitting approval or comments beyond a basic level.
- Notifications: when a new comment or mention appears, the client gets a notification via the chosen channel.

2) Internal Decision Detail (Admin)
- Internal user logs in to /internal/decisions/{decisionId}.
- See the decision overview with status, timestamps, and approval history.
- Open each option to view side-by-side comparisons, related media, and inline annotations.
- View and reply to comments; edit or delete comments within allowed windows; resolve comments if applicable.
- Add annotations to media; modify existing annotations or create new ones; link annotations to specific options if needed.
- Admin actions:
  - Edit decision details, revise option data, or adjust approvals.
  - Revoke approvals with rationale; log revoke reason in ApprovalHistory.
  - Export decision logs to PDF/JSON/CSV; download or share export URL.
- Real-time updates ensure parallel editors see changes instantly.

3) Notifications & Mentions
- Mentions trigger in-app notifications; mention recipients are auto-tagged and alerted.
- Clients and internal users receive notifications about:
  - New comments, replies, or annotations.
  - Status changes (approved, changes requested, revoked).
  - Mentions and upcoming deadlines/reminders.

4) Moderation
- Moderators can edit/delete inappropriate content within allowed windows.
- Moderation logs captured with user and timestamp.

---

## User Experience Flow

1) Event Trigger
- An architect completes a decision decision point with options; a pending approval event is generated.

2) Notification Processing
- Notification Engine constructs a Notification entity with type=approval, channels as per user preferences.
- In-app notification is created; email and SMS deliveries are queued.

3) Delivery & UX Feedback
- In-app: notification appears in user’s dashboard and client portal’s notification center with status “unread.”
- Email: SendGrid delivers the transactional email using a pre-approved template; delivery status stored.
- SMS: Twilio sends OTP (if applicable) or alert; status stored.

4) Client Portal Interaction
- Client reviews side-by-side options, comments, and can approve or request changes.
- OTP verification may be used to access the portal; successful verification unlocks the portal session.

5) Follow-up & Reminders
- If reminder is scheduled, a reminder notification is generated at the configured time. Repeats follow the cadence.

6) Preference Management
- User navigates to Settings > Notifications to adjust channels, quiet hours, or enable digests; changes propagate to future events.

7) Export & Audit
- Admin or user exports the Notification History and Decision Logs for contracts or permits.

# Notifications & Reminders

## Overview
Build a robust, scalable Notifications & Reminders system for Archject that delivers in-app, email, and optional SMS notifications for pending approvals, comments, and scheduled reminders. Include a microservice or worker-based architecture to reliably queue, retry, and idempotently deliver messages via SendGrid (Transactional Email) and Twilio (SMS). Allow user-level notification preferences, mute/snooze controls, and provide end-to-end flow from event triggers to delivery confirmation. Expose integrated UI across Client Portal (no-login link), Dashboard, and Settings/Preferences pages, with secure handling of authentication, authorization, branding, and data export.

  - On portal load, fetch decision options, comments thread, and allow actions
  - Optional OTP verification on first access, expiration and single-use enforcement
- Dashboard integration:
  - Real-time or polling-based refresh for new notifications
  - Mark as read, mute, or snooze directly from the dashboard
- Settings integration:
  - Persist user/workspace preferences and API keys
  - Trigger test sends for verification of templates and credentials
- Data consistency:
  - Use idempotent publish keys to prevent duplicate notifications
  - Use transactional storage for logs and statuses across services

---

## User Experience Flow

1) Event Trigger
- An architect completes a decision decision point with options; a pending approval event is generated.

2) Notification Processing
- Notification Engine constructs a Notification entity with type=approval, channels as per user preferences.
- In-app notification is created; email and SMS deliveries are queued.

3) Delivery & UX Feedback
- In-app: notification appears in user’s dashboard and client portal’s notification center with status “unread.”
- Email: SendGrid delivers the transactional email using a pre-approved template; delivery status stored.
- SMS: Twilio sends OTP (if applicable) or alert; status stored.

4) Client Portal Interaction
- Client reviews side-by-side options, comments, and can approve or request changes.
- OTP verification may be used to access the portal; successful verification unlocks the portal session.

5) Follow-up & Reminders
- If reminder is scheduled, a reminder notification is generated at the configured time. Repeats follow the cadence.

6) Preference Management
- User navigates to Settings > Notifications to adjust channels, quiet hours, or enable digests; changes propagate to future events.

7) Export & Audit
- Admin or user exports the Notification History and Decision Logs for contracts or permits.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] End-to-end workflow: event triggers generate in-app, email, and SMS notifications according to user preferences; all deliveries are retried on failure with backoff and a dead-letter path.
- [ ] Client Portal no-login flow works with optional OTP verification and allows side-by-side option review, commenting, and approvals/requests changes.
- [ ] Dashboard delivers real-time (or near-real-time) notifications with correct status states and quick action controls.
- [ ] Settings allow per-workspace and per-user notification preferences, with persistent changes and test API key validations.
- [ ] Data export includes complete notification history and audit trails; export formats JSON/CSV are generated successfully.
- [ ] Security: all keys are securely stored, access scoped, and PII is not exposed in logs or responses.
- [ ] Accessibility: UI elements meet AA standards; keyboard navigation and screen reader support present.
- [ ] Performance: under peak load, notification latency remains under defined SLA (e.g., 2-5 seconds for in-app, near real-time for email/SMS depending on provider).
