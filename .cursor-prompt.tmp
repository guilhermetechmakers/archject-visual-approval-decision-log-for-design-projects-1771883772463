# Modern Design Best Practices

## Philosophy

Create unique, memorable experiences while maintaining consistency through modern design principles. Every project should feel distinct yet professional, innovative yet intuitive.

---

## Landing Pages & Marketing Sites

### Hero Sections
**Go beyond static backgrounds:**
- Animated gradients with subtle movement
- Particle systems or geometric shapes floating
- Interactive canvas backgrounds (Three.js, WebGL)
- Video backgrounds with proper fallbacks
- Parallax scrolling effects
- Gradient mesh animations
- Morphing blob animations


### Layout Patterns
**Use modern grid systems:**
- Bento grids (asymmetric card layouts)
- Masonry layouts for varied content
- Feature sections with diagonal cuts or curves
- Overlapping elements with proper z-index
- Split-screen designs with scroll-triggered reveals

**Avoid:** Traditional 3-column equal grids

### Scroll Animations
**Engage users as they scroll:**
- Fade-in and slide-up animations for sections
- Scroll-triggered parallax effects
- Progress indicators for long pages
- Sticky elements that transform on scroll
- Horizontal scroll sections for portfolios
- Text reveal animations (word by word, letter by letter)
- Number counters animating into view

**Avoid:** Static pages with no scroll interaction

### Call-to-Action Areas
**Make CTAs impossible to miss:**
- Gradient buttons with hover effects
- Floating action buttons with micro-interactions
- Animated borders or glowing effects
- Scale/lift on hover
- Interactive elements that respond to mouse position
- Pulsing indicators for primary actions

---

## Dashboard Applications

### Layout Structure
**Always use collapsible side navigation:**
- Sidebar that can collapse to icons only
- Smooth transition animations between states
- Persistent navigation state (remember user preference)
- Mobile: drawer that slides in/out
- Desktop: sidebar with expand/collapse toggle
- Icons visible even when collapsed

**Structure:**
```
/dashboard (layout wrapper with sidebar)
  /dashboard/overview
  /dashboard/analytics
  /dashboard/settings
  /dashboard/users
  /dashboard/projects
```

All dashboard pages should be nested inside the dashboard layout, not separate routes.

### Data Tables
**Modern table design:**
- Sticky headers on scroll
- Row hover states with subtle elevation
- Sortable columns with clear indicators
- Pagination with items-per-page control
- Search/filter with instant feedback
- Selection checkboxes with bulk actions
- Responsive: cards on mobile, table on desktop
- Loading skeletons, not spinners
- Empty states with illustrations or helpful text

**Use modern table libraries:**
- TanStack Table (React Table v8)
- AG Grid for complex data
- Data Grid from MUI (if using MUI)

### Charts & Visualizations
**Use the latest charting libraries:**
- Recharts (for React, simple charts)
- Chart.js v4 (versatile, well-maintained)
- Apache ECharts (advanced, interactive)
- D3.js (custom, complex visualizations)
- Tremor (for dashboards, built on Recharts)

**Chart best practices:**
- Animated transitions when data changes
- Interactive tooltips with detailed info
- Responsive sizing
- Color scheme matching design system
- Legend placement that doesn't obstruct data
- Loading states while fetching data

### Dashboard Cards
**Metric cards should stand out:**
- Gradient backgrounds or colored accents
- Trend indicators (↑ ↓ with color coding)
- Sparkline charts for historical data
- Hover effects revealing more detail
- Icon representing the metric
- Comparison to previous period

---

## Color & Visual Design

### Color Palettes
**Create depth with gradients:**
- Primary gradient (not just solid primary color)
- Subtle background gradients
- Gradient text for headings
- Gradient borders on cards
- Elevated surfaces for depth

**Color usage:**
- 60-30-10 rule (dominant, secondary, accent)
- Consistent semantic colors (success, warning, error)
- Accessible contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum)

### Typography
**Create hierarchy through contrast:**
- Large, bold headings (48-72px for heroes)
- Clear size differences between levels
- Variable font weights (300, 400, 600, 700)
- Letter spacing for small caps
- Line height 1.5-1.7 for body text
- Inter, Poppins, or DM Sans for modern feel

### Shadows & Depth
**Layer UI elements:**
- Multi-layer shadows for realistic depth
- Colored shadows matching element color
- Elevated states on hover
- Neumorphism for special elements (sparingly)

---

## Interactions & Micro-animations

### Button Interactions
**Every button should react:**
- Scale slightly on hover (1.02-1.05)
- Lift with shadow on hover
- Ripple effect on click
- Loading state with spinner or progress
- Disabled state clearly visible
- Success state with checkmark animation

### Card Interactions
**Make cards feel alive:**
- Lift on hover with increased shadow
- Subtle border glow on hover
- Tilt effect following mouse (3D transform)
- Smooth transitions (200-300ms)
- Click feedback for interactive cards

### Form Interactions
**Guide users through forms:**
- Input focus states with border color change
- Floating labels that animate up
- Real-time validation with inline messages
- Success checkmarks for valid inputs
- Error states with shake animation
- Password strength indicators
- Character count for text areas

### Page Transitions
**Smooth between views:**
- Fade + slide for page changes
- Skeleton loaders during data fetch
- Optimistic UI updates
- Stagger animations for lists
- Route transition animations

---

## Mobile Responsiveness

### Mobile-First Approach
**Design for mobile, enhance for desktop:**
- Touch targets minimum 44x44px
- Generous padding and spacing
- Sticky bottom navigation on mobile
- Collapsible sections for long content
- Swipeable cards and galleries

### Responsive Patterns
**Adapt layouts intelligently:**
- Hamburger menu → full nav bar
- Card grid → stack on mobile
- Sidebar → drawer
- Multi-column → single column
- Data tables → card list
- Hide/show elements based on viewport

---

## Loading & Empty States

### Loading States
**Never leave users wondering:**
- Skeleton screens matching content layout
- Progress bars for known durations
- Animated placeholders
- Spinners only for short waits (<3s)
- Stagger loading for multiple elements
- Shimmer effects on skeletons

### Empty States
**Make empty states helpful:**
- Illustrations or icons
- Helpful copy explaining why it's empty
- Clear CTA to add first item
- Examples or suggestions
- No "no data" text alone

---

## Unique Elements to Stand Out

### Distinctive Features
**Add personality:**
- Custom cursor effects on landing pages
- Animated page numbers or section indicators
- Unusual hover effects (magnification, distortion)
- Custom scrollbars
- Glassmorphism for overlays
- Animated SVG icons

 for bestpractices and # Privacy Policy Development Prompt

Overview
Develop a fully functional Privacy Policy page for Archject that clearly communicates data usage, retention, and user rights. Include the ability to view, format, and export the policy as a PDF via exportable templates. Provide a reusable set of Legal Document Templates (Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and exportable Decision Log cover pages) to support PDF exports. This prompt yields a complete frontend page, backend data structures, templates, and export capabilities that align with the Archject design system and visual style.

Page Description (Full Detail)
What this page is
- A dedicated Privacy Policy page that presents a legally sound privacy policy describing data collection, usage, retention, sharing, user rights (access, correction, deletion, data portability), data residency notices, and contact channels. It should be accessible, readable, and skimmable, with clear subsections and a downloadable PDF export option.

Goals
- Provide a comprehensive, legally accurate, and user-friendly privacy policy.
- Ensure the policy text is structured into clearly defined sections: Data Collected, How We Use Data, Data Retention, Data Sharing, Rights of Users, Data Security, Data Residency, International Transfers (if applicable), Policy Updates, and How to Contact Us.
- Offer an export-capable template system with a generated PDF export that includes a standardized decision-log cover page when needed.
- Include region notices (GDPR/EU data residency) and a notice area for non-EU regions as applicable.
- Seamlessly integrate with the existing Archject styling, navigation, and export workflow.

Connected features
- No connected features listed in the context, but ensure the page can be extended to link to related policies (Terms of Service, Cookie Policy) and exportable Decision Logs.

UI elements and how they need to look
- Policy Text: Clear, sectioned content with readable typography. Include anchor links for accessibility and quick navigation.
- Download PDF: A prominent primary action button to export the Privacy Policy as a PDF. The export should render a print/PDF-friendly layout based on a template.
- Region Notices: Inline GDPR notices and data residency language for EU customers; optional toggles or region-specific content display if region is detected or selected.
- Accessibility: High-contrast text on white, semantic headings, labeled sections, and ARIA attributes where appropriate.

Visual guidance
- Align with Archject’s visual system: white cards, soft shadows, rounded corners, generous whitespace, and muted background layers. Use the palette and typography guidelines provided.

Visual Style (Summary)
- Colors, typography, spacing, and card design are defined in the provided palette and guidelines. Follow the Design Philosophy: modern, minimalist, accessible, and mobile-first.

Key Design Elements
- Card Design: White cards with soft shadows, rounded corners (12-16px), 24px min internal padding, hover elevation.
- Navigation: Top navigation with pill-shaped tabs, active state in deep green (#195C4A), white text; right-aligned user actions integrated with the header.
- Typography: Inter/Manrope/SF Pro-like sans-serif, font weights 400/500/600, strong page headings.
- Layout: 24-32px container padding, 16-24px gaps, 8px spacing increments, left-aligned content.
- Data Visualization: Not required for this page unless you want to show data on access/logs; if present, keep minimal and aligned with the palette.
- Interactive Elements: Primary action buttons in deep green (#195C4A). Focus rings, hover elevations, and accessible form controls.
- Status/Region Tags: If region notices appear, use subtle colored tags (green for positive, gray for neutral, yellow/red for warnings).

Design Philosophy
- Trust, transparency, clarity, and easy exportability. Clear audit trail and ready-to-file export capability. Mobile-first.

Project Context and API Integrations
- PROJECT CONTEXT: Archject — Visual Approval & Decision Log for Design Projects.
- API Integrations: No APIs connected for this task (per context). However, design should be API-agnostic and easily wired if needed (e.g., to fetch legal text segments or to trigger export functions).

Complete Components to Build
1) PrivacyPolicyPage Component
- Purpose: Render the privacy policy content with structured sections, region notices, and a PDF export action.
- Content blocks:
  - Introduction summary
  - Data Collected (categories, purposes)
  - How We Use Data
  - Data Retention
  - Data Sharing and Disclosure
  - Rights of Users
  - Data Security
  - International Transfers and Data Residency
  - Policy Updates
  - Contact Information
  - Region Notices (GDPR / EU data residency)
- Accessibility: semantic headings (h1-h3), accessible anchor links, skip-to-content support, keyboard navigable.

2) Legal Document Templates (Asset)
- Template set for:
  - Privacy Policy (primary)
  - Terms of Service (secondary)
  - Exportable Decision Log cover page (for PDF exports)
- Each template should include:
  - A pre-defined header/footer area
  - Placeholders for dynamic content (e.g., company name, region notices, version/date)
  - Standard formatting compatible with a PDF export engine
  - Consistent styling with the project’s design system
- Output formats: editable templates (e.g., Markdown or HTML templates) and export-ready PDF layout templates.

3) PDF Export Engine Integration (Exportable)
- Export flow:
  - On clicking Download PDF, render a print/PDF-friendly view using the Privacy Policy template content.
  - Include a cover page using the Decision Log cover page template if applicable (based on export context).
  - Ensure page breaks, header/footer, and dynamic content (policy sections, timestamps, version) render correctly.
- Options:
  - Include region notices on PDF
  - Include or exclude metadata (version date, last updated)
- Output: a downloadable PDF file with a clean, print-ready layout.

4) Region Notices Widget
- Optional region-aware content block that displays GDPR-related notices for EU users and data residency notes where applicable.
- Behavior:
  - Auto-detect region if possible (via locale) or allow user to select region.
  - Show/hide content accordingly.
- UI: small, non-intrusive badge or tag with an accessible disclosure.

5) Accessibility and Localization Hooks
- If localization is in play, provide content blocks that can be localized (i18n-ready strings, right-to-left support if needed).
- Ensure all form controls and interactive elements have proper ARIA labels and roles.

Implementation Requirements

Frontend
- Page: PrivacyPolicyPage with a responsive layout, card-based sections, and a primary Download PDF button.
- Components:
  - SectionCard: Card container for each policy section (title, body text).
  - RegionNotice: Inline region information block with optional disclosure.
  - PrimaryButton: Reusable, pill-shaped deep green button for actions.
  - LinkList: Internal anchor navigation for policy sections.
  - TextBlock: Rich text support (paragraphs, lists).
- Styles:
  - Use the provided color palette and typography tokens.
  - Implement hover states: subtle elevation and background changes for interactive elements.
  - Maintain consistent spacing using 8px increments and 24-32px container padding.
- Routing:
  - Route for /privacy-policy or /legal/privacy
  - Ensure the page can be embedded in project workspaces if needed.

Backend
- Data model (if policy text is stored in a CMS/db):
  - PrivacyPolicy
    - id (uuid)
    - version (string)
    - lastUpdated (datetime)
    - sections: array of Section
      - title (string)
      - content (rich text or markdown)
      - order (int)
    - regionNotices: array of RegionNotice
      - region (string)
      - content (rich text)
- PDF template data:
  - TemplateName (PrivacyPolicy, TermsOfService)
  - version
  - lastUpdated
  - companyBranding: includes logo URL, company name, contact info
- API Endpoints (if exposed):
  - GET /api/privacy-policy
    - Returns policy data with sections and notices
  - GET /api/privacy-policy/export
    - Accepts query parameters (format=pdf, region, includeNotices)
    - Returns a downloadable PDF blob
  - GET /api/legal-templates/privacy
    - Returns privacy policy template data (editable)
  - POST /api/legal-templates/preview
    - Accepts templateId and content, returns a preview render (HTML/PNG)
- Security:
  - Public access to read policy (no auth required)
  - PDF export may require authentication depending on policy (per project policy) or can be public as a branded export
- Validation:
  - Ensure content sections contain non-empty text
  - Validate region notices data structure
  - Ensure templates render with required fields (branding, date)

Integration
- Frontend to Backend:
  - PrivacyPolicyPage fetches policy data from /api/privacy-policy
  - When user clicks Download PDF, trigger /api/privacy-policy/export with current region and options
  - PDF export engine consumes template data to render final PDF
- Template Integration:
  - Use Legal Document Templates asset to populate Privacy Policy PDF layout
  - Ensure dynamic fields (companyName, lastUpdated, version) are replaced at export time
- Data Flow:
  - Client reads policy data, composes UI, and passes necessary metadata to export function
  - PDF export uses the export engine with template data and policy content

User Experience Flow
1) User lands on Privacy Policy page
2) Page loads policy sections in a clean, readable format with region notices if applicable
3) User reviews policy content, uses anchor navigation to jump to sections
4) User clicks Download PDF (primary action)
5) System renders a print-friendly PDF using Privacy Policy template, includes branding, version, and last updated
6) If region notices are applicable, they appear on the PDF as well
7) User saves or prints the PDF; optional auto-download triggers
8) If user wants to view a preview, they can use a Preview endpoint to see a rendered HTML/PNG version before export
9) If content needs editing, user or admin can update sections via CMS or template editor (if enabled)

=== TASK ===
# Privacy Policy Development Prompt

Overview
Develop a fully functional Privacy Policy page for Archject that clearly communicates data usage, retention, and user rights. Include the ability to view, format, and export the policy as a PDF via exportable templates. Provide a reusable set of Legal Document Templates (Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, and exportable Decision Log cover pages) to support PDF exports. This prompt yields a complete frontend page, backend data structures, templates, and export capabilities that align with the Archject design system and visual style.

Page Description (Full Detail)
What this page is
- A dedicated Privacy Policy page that presents a legally sound privacy policy describing data collection, usage, retention, sharing, user rights (access, correction, deletion, data portability), data residency notices, and contact channels. It should be accessible, readable, and skimmable, with clear subsections and a downloadable PDF export option.

Goals
- Provide a comprehensive, legally accurate, and user-friendly privacy policy.
- Ensure the policy text is structured into clearly defined sections: Data Collected, How We Use Data, Data Retention, Data Sharing, Rights of Users, Data Security, Data Residency, International Transfers (if applicable), Policy Updates, and How to Contact Us.
- Offer an export-capable template system with a generated PDF export that includes a standardized decision-log cover page when needed.
- Include region notices (GDPR/EU data residency) and a notice area for non-EU regions as applicable.
- Seamlessly integrate with the existing Archject styling, navigation, and export workflow.

Connected features
- No connected features listed in the context, but ensure the page can be extended to link to related policies (Terms of Service, Cookie Policy) and exportable Decision Logs.

UI elements and how they need to look
- Policy Text: Clear, sectioned content with readable typography. Include anchor links for accessibility and quick navigation.
- Download PDF: A prominent primary action button to export the Privacy Policy as a PDF. The export should render a print/PDF-friendly layout based on a template.
- Region Notices: Inline GDPR notices and data residency language for EU customers; optional toggles or region-specific content display if region is detected or selected.
- Accessibility: High-contrast text on white, semantic headings, labeled sections, and ARIA attributes where appropriate.

Visual guidance
- Align with Archject’s visual system: white cards, soft shadows, rounded corners, generous whitespace, and muted background layers. Use the palette and typography guidelines provided.

Visual Style (Summary)
- Colors, typography, spacing, and card design are defined in the provided palette and guidelines. Follow the Design Philosophy: modern, minimalist, accessible, and mobile-first.

Key Design Elements
- Card Design: White cards with soft shadows, rounded corners (12-16px), 24px min internal padding, hover elevation.
- Navigation: Top navigation with pill-shaped tabs, active state in deep green (#195C4A), white text; right-aligned user actions integrated with the header.
- Typography: Inter/Manrope/SF Pro-like sans-serif, font weights 400/500/600, strong page headings.
- Layout: 24-32px container padding, 16-24px gaps, 8px spacing increments, left-aligned content.
- Data Visualization: Not required for this page unless you want to show data on access/logs; if present, keep minimal and aligned with the palette.
- Interactive Elements: Primary action buttons in deep green (#195C4A). Focus rings, hover elevations, and accessible form controls.
- Status/Region Tags: If region notices appear, use subtle colored tags (green for positive, gray for neutral, yellow/red for warnings).

Design Philosophy
- Trust, transparency, clarity, and easy exportability. Clear audit trail and ready-to-file export capability. Mobile-first.

Project Context and API Integrations
- PROJECT CONTEXT: Archject — Visual Approval & Decision Log for Design Projects.
- API Integrations: No APIs connected for this task (per context). However, design should be API-agnostic and easily wired if needed (e.g., to fetch legal text segments or to trigger export functions).

Complete Components to Build
1) PrivacyPolicyPage Component
- Purpose: Render the privacy policy content with structured sections, region notices, and a PDF export action.
- Content blocks:
  - Introduction summary
  - Data Collected (categories, purposes)
  - How We Use Data
  - Data Retention
  - Data Sharing and Disclosure
  - Rights of Users
  - Data Security
  - International Transfers and Data Residency
  - Policy Updates
  - Contact Information
  - Region Notices (GDPR / EU data residency)
- Accessibility: semantic headings (h1-h3), accessible anchor links, skip-to-content support, keyboard navigable.

2) Legal Document Templates (Asset)
- Template set for:
  - Privacy Policy (primary)
  - Terms of Service (secondary)
  - Exportable Decision Log cover page (for PDF exports)
- Each template should include:
  - A pre-defined header/footer area
  - Placeholders for dynamic content (e.g., company name, region notices, version/date)
  - Standard formatting compatible with a PDF export engine
  - Consistent styling with the project’s design system
- Output formats: editable templates (e.g., Markdown or HTML templates) and export-ready PDF layout templates.

3) PDF Export Engine Integration (Exportable)
- Export flow:
  - On clicking Download PDF, render a print/PDF-friendly view using the Privacy Policy template content.
  - Include a cover page using the Decision Log cover page template if applicable (based on export context).
  - Ensure page breaks, header/footer, and dynamic content (policy sections, timestamps, version) render correctly.
- Options:
  - Include region notices on PDF
  - Include or exclude metadata (version date, last updated)
- Output: a downloadable PDF file with a clean, print-ready layout.

4) Region Notices Widget
- Optional region-aware content block that displays GDPR-related notices for EU users and data residency notes where applicable.
- Behavior:
  - Auto-detect region if possible (via locale) or allow user to select region.
  - Show/hide content accordingly.
- UI: small, non-intrusive badge or tag with an accessible disclosure.

5) Accessibility and Localization Hooks
- If localization is in play, provide content blocks that can be localized (i18n-ready strings, right-to-left support if needed).
- Ensure all form controls and interactive elements have proper ARIA labels and roles.

Implementation Requirements

Frontend
- Page: PrivacyPolicyPage with a responsive layout, card-based sections, and a primary Download PDF button.
- Components:
  - SectionCard: Card container for each policy section (title, body text).
  - RegionNotice: Inline region information block with optional disclosure.
  - PrimaryButton: Reusable, pill-shaped deep green button for actions.
  - LinkList: Internal anchor navigation for policy sections.
  - TextBlock: Rich text support (paragraphs, lists).
- Styles:
  - Use the provided color palette and typography tokens.
  - Implement hover states: subtle elevation and background changes for interactive elements.
  - Maintain consistent spacing using 8px increments and 24-32px container padding.
- Routing:
  - Route for /privacy-policy or /legal/privacy
  - Ensure the page can be embedded in project workspaces if needed.

Backend
- Data model (if policy text is stored in a CMS/db):
  - PrivacyPolicy
    - id (uuid)
    - version (string)
    - lastUpdated (datetime)
    - sections: array of Section
      - title (string)
      - content (rich text or markdown)
      - order (int)
    - regionNotices: array of RegionNotice
      - region (string)
      - content (rich text)
- PDF template data:
  - TemplateName (PrivacyPolicy, TermsOfService)
  - version
  - lastUpdated
  - companyBranding: includes logo URL, company name, contact info
- API Endpoints (if exposed):
  - GET /api/privacy-policy
    - Returns policy data with sections and notices
  - GET /api/privacy-policy/export
    - Accepts query parameters (format=pdf, region, includeNotices)
    - Returns a downloadable PDF blob
  - GET /api/legal-templates/privacy
    - Returns privacy policy template data (editable)
  - POST /api/legal-templates/preview
    - Accepts templateId and content, returns a preview render (HTML/PNG)
- Security:
  - Public access to read policy (no auth required)
  - PDF export may require authentication depending on policy (per project policy) or can be public as a branded export
- Validation:
  - Ensure content sections contain non-empty text
  - Validate region notices data structure
  - Ensure templates render with required fields (branding, date)

Integration
- Frontend to Backend:
  - PrivacyPolicyPage fetches policy data from /api/privacy-policy
  - When user clicks Download PDF, trigger /api/privacy-policy/export with current region and options
  - PDF export engine consumes template data to render final PDF
- Template Integration:
  - Use Legal Document Templates asset to populate Privacy Policy PDF layout
  - Ensure dynamic fields (companyName, lastUpdated, version) are replaced at export time
- Data Flow:
  - Client reads policy data, composes UI, and passes necessary metadata to export function
  - PDF export uses the export engine with template data and policy content

User Experience Flow
1) User lands on Privacy Policy page
2) Page loads policy sections in a clean, readable format with region notices if applicable
3) User reviews policy content, uses anchor navigation to jump to sections
4) User clicks Download PDF (primary action)
5) System renders a print-friendly PDF using Privacy Policy template, includes branding, version, and last updated
6) If region notices are applicable, they appear on the PDF as well
7) User saves or prints the PDF; optional auto-download triggers
8) If user wants to view a preview, they can use a Preview endpoint to see a rendered HTML/PNG version before export
9) If content needs editing, user or admin can update sections via CMS or template editor (if enabled)
