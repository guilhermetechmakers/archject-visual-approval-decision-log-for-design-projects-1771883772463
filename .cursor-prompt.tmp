# Project-Specific Customizations

**IMPORTANT: This section contains the specific design requirements for THIS project. The guidelines above are universal best practices - these customizations below take precedence for project-specific decisions.**

## User Design Requirements

Client Portal and Internal Decision Detail.
  - Card-based, grid layouts, accessible components, responsive behavior (mobile-first).
  - Inline media annotation tools with zoom/pan, scrubber for media timeline (if applicable).
  - Rich text input with mention suggestions, emoji support optional.

---

## Implementation Requirements

### Frontend
- Build a cohesive design system-aligned UI:
  - Reusable React/Vue/Svelte components (Card, Button, Input, Tag, Tabs, MediaViewer, AnnotationOverlay, CommentThread).
  - MediaAnnotationOverlay component capable of rendering shapes, showing metadata, and allowing edits by authorized users.
  - CommentThread component with nested replies, edit/delete windows, mention highlighting, and inline actions (edit, delete, resolve).
  - Side-by-side OptionComparison component: responsive grid that adapts to viewport; shows media, specs, cost, and decision notes per option.
  - Real-time update indicators (typing, new comments, annotation changes).

- Pages:
  - Client Portal (No-login Link):
    - Route: /client-portal/:decisionToken
    - Features: authentication via token, side-by-side comparison, comment composer with mentions, annotation-capable media, approve/change-request actions, optional OTP flow.
  - Decision Detail (Internal):
    - Route: /internal/decisions/:decisionId
    - Features: full decision data, option-by-option annotations, audit trail, export controls, moderation tools, admin actions.

- Accessibility:
  - ARIA roles, keyboard navigable, proper focus management, readable contrast (WCAG 2.1 AA).

- Internationalization:
  - Prepare for i18n (text keys, date/number localization) if needed.

- Performance:
  - Lazy loading of options/media, pagination for comments, efficient annotation rendering for large media.
  - Debounced input for comment typing, optimistic UI updates.

- Mobile-first considerations:
  - Stacked layout with collapsible sections, touch-friendly controls, and large tap targets.

- Testing:
  - Unit tests for models and services, integration tests for end-to-end comment flow, WebSocket events, and export generation.

### Backend
- Data Models (SQL/NoSQL as appropriate):
  - User: id, name, email, role, preferences.
  - Project: id, name, branding tokens, default settings.
  - Decision: id, project_id, title, status (pending/approved/revoked/needs_changes), created_at, updated_at, approved_by, approved_at, revoked_at.
  - Option: id, decision_id, title, description, media_ids, specs, price, comparison_rank.
  - Media: id, asset_url, type (image/pdf/3d), media_metadata, linked_annotations (array of annotation_ids).
  - Annotation: id, media_id, option_id (nullable), shape_type (point/rect/polygon), coordinates (JSON), created_by, created_at, updated_by, updated_at, note.
  - Comment: id, decision_id, option_id (nullable), parent_id (nullable for threading), author_id, text, mentions (array of user_ids), created_at, updated_at, edited_by, edited_at, status (active/edited/deleted).
  - Notification: id, user_id, type (mention/comment/approval), reference_id, read_at, created_at.
  - ApprovalHistory: id, decision_id, user_id, action (created/approved/rejected/edited), timestamp, details (JSON).
  - Export: id, decision_id, type (pdf/json/csv), generated_at, url.

- APIs (REST or GraphQL):
  - Decisions
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}
    - POST /api/decisions
    - PUT /api/decisions/{id}
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/approve
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/revoke
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}/export
  - Options
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}/options
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/options
  - Media-Annotations
    - POST /api/media/{media_id}/annotations
    - PUT /api/annotations/{id}
    - DELETE /api/annotations/{id}
    - GET /api/media/{media_id}/annotations
  - Comments
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}/comments
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/comments
    - PUT /api/comments/{id}
    - DELETE /api/comments/{id}
  - Mentions & Notifications
    - POST /api/notifications/mention
    - GET /api/notifications?user_id=...
  - Real-time
    - WebSocket channel endpoints for /ws/decisions/{decisionId}
  - Exports
    - GET /api/exports/{export_id}
  - Auth
    - OAuth2 / JWT-based authentication; token validation; role checks.

- Database indexing and constraints:
  - Index on decision_id for comments, annotations; index on media_id; composite indexes for option and decision lookups.
  - Foreign keys: decision -> project; option -> decision; annotation -> media/option; comment -> decision/option/parent; notification -> user.

- Real-time & Messaging:
  - WebSocket channels per decision for comments and annotation updates.
  - Fallback to long-polling if WebSockets unavailable.
  - Debounce rapid comment streams; ensure at-least-once delivery semantics.

- Security:
  - No-login access tokens for client portal with expiration; token rotation.
  - Server-side validation for all inputs; server-side enforcement of business rules (e.g., cannot approve after revoke).
  - Rate limiting on comment POSTs and OTP validation; detect and mitigate abuse.

- Data Integrity & Auditing:
  - Immutable audit entries for approvals and edits; versioning for comments and annotations (with delta diffs if feasible).
  - Export exports reproduce exact state snapshots with timestamps.

### Integration
- Client Portal and Internal Decision Detail both consume the same backend APIs:
  - Shared data models for decisions, options, media, comments, and annotations.
  - Client Portal uses a token-based access path with read/write scoped permissions; Limited comment actions, no admin controls.
  - Internal view uses full permissions (create/edit/delete, export, revoke).

- Branding & Theming:
  - Centralized design tokens for colors, font sizes, spacing, radii.
  - Components should adapt to the brand’s palette and be override-ready for client-specific branding.

- Error Handling:
  - Consistent error payload structure; user-friendly messages; telemetry hooks for errors.

---

## User Experience Flow

1) Client Portal (No-login Link)
- Client opens a shareable link to a decision with side-by-side options.
- Client views media and option details; annotations are visible and can be added by authorized clients if permitted.
- Client adds a comment, optionally mentioning internal team members. Comment appears in real-time or near real-time.
- Client annotates media coordinates to indicate preferences or concerns (where allowed).
- Client can approve or request changes, optionally leaving a short note; action triggers a notification to internal stakeholders.
- If OTP/verification is enabled:
  - Client enters email (if captured) or phone to receive an OTP.
  - Client enters OTP to validate before submitting approval or comments beyond a basic level.
- Notifications: when a new comment or mention appears, the client gets a notification via the chosen channel.

2) Internal Decision Detail (Admin)
- Internal user logs in to /internal/decisions/{decisionId}.
- See the decision overview with status, timestamps, and approval history.
- Open each option to view side-by-side comparisons, related media, and inline annotations.
- View and reply to comments; edit or delete comments within allowed windows; resolve comments if applicable.
- Add annotations to media; modify existing annotations or create new ones; link annotations to specific options if needed.
- Admin actions:
  - Edit decision details, revise option data, or adjust approvals.
  - Revoke approvals with rationale; log revoke reason in ApprovalHistory.
  - Export decision logs to PDF/JSON/CSV; download or share export URL.
- Real-time updates ensure parallel editors see changes instantly.

3) Notifications & Mentions
- Mentions trigger in-app notifications; mention recipients are auto-tagged and alerted.
- Clients and internal users receive notifications about:
  - New comments, replies, or annotations.
  - Status changes (approved, changes requested, revoked).
  - Mentions and upcoming deadlines/reminders.

4) Moderation
- Moderators can edit/delete inappropriate content within allowed windows.
- Moderation logs captured with user and timestamp.

**Never leave users wondering:**
- Skeleton screens matching content layout
- Progress bars for known durations
- Animated placeholders
- Spinners only for short waits (<3s)
- Stagger loading for multiple elements
- Shimmer effects on skeletons

### Empty States
**Make empty states helpful:**
- Illustrations or icons
- Helpful copy explaining why it's empty
- Clear CTA to add first item
- Examples or suggestions
- No "no data" text alone

# Project-Specific Customizations

**IMPORTANT: This section contains the specific design requirements for THIS project. The guidelines above are universal best practices - these customizations below take precedence for project-specific decisions.**

## User Design Requirements

Client Portal and Internal Decision Detail.
  - Card-based, grid layouts, accessible components, responsive behavior (mobile-first).
  - Inline media annotation tools with zoom/pan, scrubber for media timeline (if applicable).
  - Rich text input with mention suggestions, emoji support optional.

---

## Implementation Requirements

### Frontend
- Build a cohesive design system-aligned UI:
  - Reusable React/Vue/Svelte components (Card, Button, Input, Tag, Tabs, MediaViewer, AnnotationOverlay, CommentThread).
  - MediaAnnotationOverlay component capable of rendering shapes, showing metadata, and allowing edits by authorized users.
  - CommentThread component with nested replies, edit/delete windows, mention highlighting, and inline actions (edit, delete, resolve).
  - Side-by-side OptionComparison component: responsive grid that adapts to viewport; shows media, specs, cost, and decision notes per option.
  - Real-time update indicators (typing, new comments, annotation changes).

- Pages:
  - Client Portal (No-login Link):
    - Route: /client-portal/:decisionToken
    - Features: authentication via token, side-by-side comparison, comment composer with mentions, annotation-capable media, approve/change-request actions, optional OTP flow.
  - Decision Detail (Internal):
    - Route: /internal/decisions/:decisionId
    - Features: full decision data, option-by-option annotations, audit trail, export controls, moderation tools, admin actions.

- Accessibility:
  - ARIA roles, keyboard navigable, proper focus management, readable contrast (WCAG 2.1 AA).

- Internationalization:
  - Prepare for i18n (text keys, date/number localization) if needed.

- Performance:
  - Lazy loading of options/media, pagination for comments, efficient annotation rendering for large media.
  - Debounced input for comment typing, optimistic UI updates.

- Mobile-first considerations:
  - Stacked layout with collapsible sections, touch-friendly controls, and large tap targets.

- Testing:
  - Unit tests for models and services, integration tests for end-to-end comment flow, WebSocket events, and export generation.

### Backend
- Data Models (SQL/NoSQL as appropriate):
  - User: id, name, email, role, preferences.
  - Project: id, name, branding tokens, default settings.
  - Decision: id, project_id, title, status (pending/approved/revoked/needs_changes), created_at, updated_at, approved_by, approved_at, revoked_at.
  - Option: id, decision_id, title, description, media_ids, specs, price, comparison_rank.
  - Media: id, asset_url, type (image/pdf/3d), media_metadata, linked_annotations (array of annotation_ids).
  - Annotation: id, media_id, option_id (nullable), shape_type (point/rect/polygon), coordinates (JSON), created_by, created_at, updated_by, updated_at, note.
  - Comment: id, decision_id, option_id (nullable), parent_id (nullable for threading), author_id, text, mentions (array of user_ids), created_at, updated_at, edited_by, edited_at, status (active/edited/deleted).
  - Notification: id, user_id, type (mention/comment/approval), reference_id, read_at, created_at.
  - ApprovalHistory: id, decision_id, user_id, action (created/approved/rejected/edited), timestamp, details (JSON).
  - Export: id, decision_id, type (pdf/json/csv), generated_at, url.

- APIs (REST or GraphQL):
  - Decisions
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}
    - POST /api/decisions
    - PUT /api/decisions/{id}
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/approve
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/revoke

    - GET /api/media/{media_id}/annotations
  - Comments
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}/comments
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/comments
    - PUT /api/comments/{id}
    - DELETE /api/comments/{id}
  - Mentions & Notifications
    - POST /api/notifications/mention
    - GET /api/notifications?user_id=...
  - Real-time
    - WebSocket channel endpoints for /ws/decisions/{decisionId}
  - Exports
    - GET /api/exports/{export_id}
  - Auth
    - OAuth2 / JWT-based authentication; token validation; role checks.

- Database indexing and constraints:
  - Index on decision_id for comments, annotations; index on media_id; composite indexes for option and decision lookups.
  - Foreign keys: decision -> project; option -> decision; annotation -> media/option; comment -> decision/option/parent; notification -> user.

- Real-time & Messaging:
  - WebSocket channels per decision for comments and annotation updates.
  - Fallback to long-polling if WebSockets unavailable.
  - Debounce rapid comment streams; ensure at-least-once delivery semantics.

- Security:
  - No-login access tokens for client portal with expiration; token rotation.
  - Server-side validation for all inputs; server-side enforcement of business rules (e.g., cannot approve after revoke).
  - Rate limiting on comment POSTs and OTP validation; detect and mitigate abuse.

- Data Integrity & Auditing:
  - Immutable audit entries for approvals and edits; versioning for comments and annotations (with delta diffs if feasible).
  - Export exports reproduce exact state snapshots with timestamps.

### Integration
- Client Portal and Internal Decision Detail both consume the same backend APIs:
  - Shared data models for decisions, options, media, comments, and annotations.
  - Client Portal uses a token-based access path with read/write scoped permissions; Limited comment actions, no admin controls.
  - Internal view uses full permissions (create/edit/delete, export, revoke).

- Branding & Theming:
  - Centralized design tokens for colors, font sizes, spacing, radii.
  - Components should adapt to the brand’s palette and be override-ready for client-specific branding.

- Error Handling:
  - Consistent error payload structure; user-friendly messages; telemetry hooks for errors.

---

## User Experience Flow

1) Client Portal (No-login Link)
- Client opens a shareable link to a decision with side-by-side options.
- Client views media and option details; annotations are visible and can be added by authorized clients if permitted.
- Client adds a comment, optionally mentioning internal team members. Comment appears in real-time or near real-time.
- Client annotates media coordinates to indicate preferences or concerns (where allowed).
- Client can approve or request changes, optionally leaving a short note; action triggers a notification to internal stakeholders.
- If OTP/verification is enabled:
  - Client enters email (if captured) or phone to receive an OTP.
  - Client enters OTP to validate before submitting approval or comments beyond a basic level.
- Notifications: when a new comment or mention appears, the client gets a notification via the chosen channel.

2) Internal Decision Detail (Admin)
- Internal user logs in to /internal/decisions/{decisionId}.
- See the decision overview with status, timestamps, and approval history.
- Open each option to view side-by-side comparisons, related media, and inline annotations.
- View and reply to comments; edit or delete comments within allowed windows; resolve comments if applicable.
- Add annotations to media; modify existing annotations or create new ones; link annotations to specific options if needed.
- Admin actions:
  - Edit decision details, revise option data, or adjust approvals.
  - Revoke approvals with rationale; log revoke reason in ApprovalHistory.
  - Export decision logs to PDF/JSON/CSV; download or share export URL.
- Real-time updates ensure parallel editors see changes instantly.

3) Notifications & Mentions
- Mentions trigger in-app notifications; mention recipients are auto-tagged and alerted.
- Clients and internal users receive notifications about:
  - New comments, replies, or annotations.
  - Status changes (approved, changes requested, revoked).
  - Mentions and upcoming deadlines/reminders.

4) Moderation
- Moderators can edit/delete inappropriate content within allowed windows.
- Moderation logs captured with user and timestamp.

 for bestpractices and # Analytics & Reporting

## Overview
Build a studio-facing Analytics & Reporting module for Archject that surfaces decision bottlenecks, client responsiveness, and template performance. This feature includes event tracking integration (Segment/Amplitude) for decision lifecycle events, pre-aggregated metrics via a time-series analytics engine, scheduled report exports, and permissioned report sharing. It comprises a Dashboard (user-specific) and Analytics & Reports pages designed with Archject’s design system. The solution should deliver performant dashboards, flexible filtering, role-based access, and exportable insights to support decision efficiency and accountability.

## Components to Build
1) Analytics & Reporting Core
- Purpose: Studio-facing analytics workspace with decision bottlenecks, client responsiveness, and template performance metrics.
- Data types: decision lifecycle events (created, proposed, responded, approved/rejected, time-to-response), client engagement events (link views, message replies), template usage (templates, options selected, frequency), project metadata (status, due dates, assigned designer).
- Storage/Compute: Time-series data store or analytics engine (e.g., timescaleDB/ClickHouse or managed analytics service) with pre-aggregation by day/week/month, per-workspace, per-project, and per-template.
- Outputs: Time-series dashboards, KPI cards, funnel visuals, heatmaps, and tabular drill-downs with export capabilities.
- Integrations: Segment/Amplitude event tracking; optional webhooks for scheduled exports.

2) Segment / Analytics (Event Tracking)
- Purpose: Capture event data for analytics dashboards and usage metrics.
- Events to capture (example list, adjust to actual lifecycle):
  - lamp: decision_created, decision_proposed, decision_updated, decision_client_view, decision_client_reply, decision_approved, decision_rejected, decision_closed
  - template_viewed, template_used, template_prefilled
  - project_viewed, project_updated
  - link_shared, link_viewed, link_downloaded
  - user_logged_in, workspace_switched
  - export_requested, export_completed, report_scheduled
- Properties for events: workspace_id, project_id, decision_id, template_id, user_id, client_id (if applicable), timestamp, decision_status, response_time_ms, template_completion_rate, decision_duration_ms, device, browser, location (approx), channel (web/mobile), export_format, report_id.
- Data quality: Enforce consistent event naming, standardized property keys, and time zone normalization (UTC).

3) Dashboard (user-specific)
- Purpose: Personal view for each studio user showing active projects, decisions awaiting client response, recent activity, and quick actions (create a decision, share client links).
- UI Components: 
  - Header with workspace selector, user avatar, quick actions
  - KPI strip: total active projects, decisions awaiting client response, average decision duration, template adoption rate
  - Active Projects Table: project, current decision, next action, due date, owner
  - Decisions Awaiting Client Response: list with countdown timers, client name, days since last update
  - Recent Activity Feed: timestamped activity items
  - Quick Actions: Create Decision, Share Client Link (copy), Schedule Reminder
  - Trend Cards: 7/30/90-day trend lines for decisions created, responses, and templates used
  - Filters: date range, workspace, project status, template, client responsiveness window, min response time
  - Export/Share: export current dashboard view as PDF/CSV, shareable link with proper permissions
- Interactions: Drill-down from a project to its decision history; hover tooltips on charts; click-to-filter on charts; responsive layout for mobile

4) Analytics & Reports Page
- Purpose: Analytical views for studios focusing on decision response times, bottlenecks, most-used templates, and client responsiveness metrics.
- UI Components:
  - Multi-panel layout with cards and charts
  - Time-series charts: decision created vs. responded, bottleneck latency by stage, template usage over time
  - Bottleneck Heatmap: stage-by-stage average response time
  - Client Responsiveness Matrix: clients vs. average response time and response rate
  - Template Performance Table: templates with usage, average time to decision, success rate
  - Segmented filters: workspace, date range, project type, client segment, template
  - Export & Scheduling: Export current view, schedule recurring reports (PDF/CSV) to emails or internal storage
- Interactions: Cross-filtering between charts; sortable tables; pagination; export previews
- Access Control: Per-workspace permissions; ability to restrict report sharing to specified roles or users; public client-link sharing must still enforce permissions.

- Scheduling:
  - Background job to generate scheduled reports (PDF/CSV) and email to recipients
  - Support for recurring cadence: daily/weekly/monthly
- Data Retention:
  - Configurable retention policies; archival strategy for very old data
- Performance:
  - Use caching for frequently requested aggregates; paginate large tables; optimize hot paths in analytics endpoints

### Integration
- Data Ingestion:
  - Instrument Segment/Amplitude event tracking on decision lifecycle events
  - Normalize event properties into consistent schema
  - Emit events to analytics engine for pre-aggregation
- UI ↔ Backend:
  - Frontend requests for dashboards and reports fetch pre-aggregated metrics; charts subscribe to real-time or batched updates
  - Actions (export, schedule) trigger background processes and return job IDs with status endpoints
- Access Control:
  - Enforce workspace-based permissions for all analytics endpoints
  - Ensure restricted sharing: reports can be shared within allowed recipients; client-facing links verify permissions

## User Experience Flow

1) User logs in and selects a workspace
2) User navigates to Dashboard (page_dashboard)
3) Dashboard loads: shows active projects, decisions awaiting client responses, recent activity, and quick actions
4) User uses filters (date range, workspace, project type) to refine view
5) User opens Analytics & Reports (page_analytics)
6) User views decision response time trends, bottleneck heatmaps, and template performance
7) User applies cross-filters (client segment, template) to see drill-down metrics
8) User exports current view as PDF/CSV or schedules a recurring report to be emailed
9) User shares a report with teammates or external stakeholders via secure links (permissioned)
10) Segmented events are captured via Segment/Amplitude to feed dashboards and metrics

# Analytics & Reporting

## Overview
Build a studio-facing Analytics & Reporting module for Archject that surfaces decision bottlenecks, client responsiveness, and template performance. This feature includes event tracking integration (Segment/Amplitude) for decision lifecycle events, pre-aggregated metrics via a time-series analytics engine, scheduled report exports, and permissioned report sharing. It comprises a Dashboard (user-specific) and Analytics & Reports pages designed with Archject’s design system. The solution should deliver performant dashboards, flexible filtering, role-based access, and exportable insights to support decision efficiency and accountability.

## Components to Build
1) Analytics & Reporting Core
- Purpose: Studio-facing analytics workspace with decision bottlenecks, client responsiveness, and template performance metrics.
- Data types: decision lifecycle events (created, proposed, responded, approved/rejected, time-to-response), client engagement events (link views, message replies), template usage (templates, options selected, frequency), project metadata (status, due dates, assigned designer).
- Storage/Compute: Time-series data store or analytics engine (e.g., timescaleDB/ClickHouse or managed analytics service) with pre-aggregation by day/week/month, per-workspace, per-project, and per-template.
- Outputs: Time-series dashboards, KPI cards, funnel visuals, heatmaps, and tabular drill-downs with export capabilities.
- Integrations: Segment/Amplitude event tracking; optional webhooks for scheduled exports.

2) Segment / Analytics (Event Tracking)
- Purpose: Capture event data for analytics dashboards and usage metrics.
- Events to capture (example list, adjust to actual lifecycle):
  - lamp: decision_created, decision_proposed, decision_updated, decision_client_view, decision_client_reply, decision_approved, decision_rejected, decision_closed
  - template_viewed, template_used, template_prefilled
  - project_viewed, project_updated
  - link_shared, link_viewed, link_downloaded
  - user_logged_in, workspace_switched
  - export_requested, export_completed, report_scheduled
- Properties for events: workspace_id, project_id, decision_id, template_id, user_id, client_id (if applicable), timestamp, decision_status, response_time_ms, template_completion_rate, decision_duration_ms, device, browser, location (approx), channel (web/mobile), export_format, report_id.
- Data quality: Enforce consistent event naming, standardized property keys, and time zone normalization (UTC).

3) Dashboard (user-specific)
- Purpose: Personal view for each studio user showing active projects, decisions awaiting client response, recent activity, and quick actions (create a decision, share client links).
- UI Components: 
  - Header with workspace selector, user avatar, quick actions
  - KPI strip: total active projects, decisions awaiting client response, average decision duration, template adoption rate
  - Active Projects Table: project, current decision, next action, due date, owner
  - Decisions Awaiting Client Response: list with countdown timers, client name, days since last update
  - Recent Activity Feed: timestamped activity items
  - Quick Actions: Create Decision, Share Client Link (copy), Schedule Reminder
  - Trend Cards: 7/30/90-day trend lines for decisions created, responses, and templates used
  - Filters: date range, workspace, project status, template, client responsiveness window, min response time
  - Export/Share: export current dashboard view as PDF/CSV, shareable link with proper permissions
- Interactions: Drill-down from a project to its decision history; hover tooltips on charts; click-to-filter on charts; responsive layout for mobile

4) Analytics & Reports Page
- Purpose: Analytical views for studios focusing on decision response times, bottlenecks, most-used templates, and client responsiveness metrics.
- UI Components:
  - Multi-panel layout with cards and charts
  - Time-series charts: decision created vs. responded, bottleneck latency by stage, template usage over time
  - Bottleneck Heatmap: stage-by-stage average response time
  - Client Responsiveness Matrix: clients vs. average response time and response rate
  - Template Performance Table: templates with usage, average time to decision, success rate
  - Segmented filters: workspace, date range, project type, client segment, template
  - Export & Scheduling: Export current view, schedule recurring reports (PDF/CSV) to emails or internal storage
- Interactions: Cross-filtering between charts; sortable tables; pagination; export previews
- Access Control: Per-workspace permissions; ability to restrict report sharing to specified roles or users; public client-link sharing must still enforce permissions.

## Implementation Requirements

### Frontend
- Pages:
  - Dashboard (page_dashboard)
  - Analytics & Reports (page_analytics)
- Components:
  - Card components with consistent shadow, padding, and typography
  - KPI tiles with trend indicators
  - Data visualization components: line charts, bar charts, heatmaps, funnels, and tables
  - Filters panel with date range picker, multi-selects, and search
  - Action bar: Create Decision, Share Link, Schedule Export
  - Download/Export buttons with progress indicators
  - Responsive grid layout with 8px spacing increments; 24-32px container padding
- Interactions:
  - Hover states with subtle elevation; focus rings for accessibility
  - Charts with accessible legends and tooltips
  - Drill-down navigation from dashboard to project/decision detail
  - Real-time or near-real-time refresh for current dashboards (configurable)
- Accessibility:
  - Keyboard navigable controls, ARIA labels, proper contrast (per WCAG 2.1 AA)
  - Screen reader friendly labels for charts and controls

### Backend
- APIs:
  - GET /workspaces/{workspace_id}/analytics/dashboard
  - GET /workspaces/{workspace_id}/analytics/reports
  - POST /workspaces/{workspace_id}/analytics/reports/schedule
  - POST /workspaces/{workspace_id}/analytics/export
  - POST /segment/track with event payload
  - GET /workspaces/{workspace_id}/projects/{project_id}/decisions/{decision_id}/analytics
  - PUT /workspaces/{workspace_id}/reports/{report_id}/share (permissions)
- Data Models:
  - Events: event_id, workspace_id, project_id, decision_id, template_id, user_id, event_name, properties (JSON), timestamp, context
  - Decisions: decision_id, project_id, template_id, status, created_at, due_date, client_last_response_at, owner_id
  - Projects: project_id, workspace_id, name, status, start_date, due_date, template_id, owner_id
  - Templates: template_id, name, usage_count, last_used_at
  - Reports: report_id, workspace_id, name, schedule_cron, recipients, format, last_run, status
  - Exports: export_id, workspace_id, format, generated_at, status, file_url
- Aggregations:
  - Pre-aggregate metrics: daily/weekly counts of decisions created, responded, average response times, template usage rates, client response rates
  - Time-series indices: by date, workspace, project, decision stage, template
- Scheduling:
  - Background job to generate scheduled reports (PDF/CSV) and email to recipients
  - Support for recurring cadence: daily/weekly/monthly
- Data Retention:
  - Configurable retention policies; archival strategy for very old data
- Performance:
  - Use caching for frequently requested aggregates; paginate large tables; optimize hot paths in analytics endpoints

### Integration
- Data Ingestion:
  - Instrument Segment/Amplitude event tracking on decision lifecycle events
  - Normalize event properties into consistent schema
  - Emit events to analytics engine for pre-aggregation
- UI ↔ Backend:
  - Frontend requests for dashboards and reports fetch pre-aggregated metrics; charts subscribe to real-time or batched updates
  - Actions (export, schedule) trigger background processes and return job IDs with status endpoints
- Access Control:
  - Enforce workspace-based permissions for all analytics endpoints
  - Ensure restricted sharing: reports can be shared within allowed recipients; client-facing links verify permissions

## User Experience Flow

1) User logs in and selects a workspace
2) User navigates to Dashboard (page_dashboard)
3) Dashboard loads: shows active projects, decisions awaiting client responses, recent activity, and quick actions
4) User uses filters (date range, workspace, project type) to refine view
5) User opens Analytics & Reports (page_analytics)
6) User views decision response time trends, bottleneck heatmaps, and template performance
7) User applies cross-filters (client segment, template) to see drill-down metrics
8) User exports current view as PDF/CSV or schedules a recurring report to be emailed
9) User shares a report with teammates or external stakeholders via secure links (permissioned)
10) Segmented events are captured via Segment/Amplitude to feed dashboards and metrics
