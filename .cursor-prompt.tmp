# Project-Specific Customizations

**IMPORTANT: This section contains the specific design requirements for THIS project. The guidelines above are universal best practices - these customizations below take precedence for project-specific decisions.**

## User Design Requirements

Client Portal and Internal Decision Detail.
  - Card-based, grid layouts, accessible components, responsive behavior (mobile-first).
  - Inline media annotation tools with zoom/pan, scrubber for media timeline (if applicable).
  - Rich text input with mention suggestions, emoji support optional.

---

## Implementation Requirements

### Frontend
- Build a cohesive design system-aligned UI:
  - Reusable React/Vue/Svelte components (Card, Button, Input, Tag, Tabs, MediaViewer, AnnotationOverlay, CommentThread).
  - MediaAnnotationOverlay component capable of rendering shapes, showing metadata, and allowing edits by authorized users.
  - CommentThread component with nested replies, edit/delete windows, mention highlighting, and inline actions (edit, delete, resolve).
  - Side-by-side OptionComparison component: responsive grid that adapts to viewport; shows media, specs, cost, and decision notes per option.
  - Real-time update indicators (typing, new comments, annotation changes).

- Pages:
  - Client Portal (No-login Link):
    - Route: /client-portal/:decisionToken
    - Features: authentication via token, side-by-side comparison, comment composer with mentions, annotation-capable media, approve/change-request actions, optional OTP flow.
  - Decision Detail (Internal):
    - Route: /internal/decisions/:decisionId
    - Features: full decision data, option-by-option annotations, audit trail, export controls, moderation tools, admin actions.

- Accessibility:
  - ARIA roles, keyboard navigable, proper focus management, readable contrast (WCAG 2.1 AA).

- Internationalization:
  - Prepare for i18n (text keys, date/number localization) if needed.

- Performance:
  - Lazy loading of options/media, pagination for comments, efficient annotation rendering for large media.
  - Debounced input for comment typing, optimistic UI updates.

- Mobile-first considerations:
  - Stacked layout with collapsible sections, touch-friendly controls, and large tap targets.

- Testing:
  - Unit tests for models and services, integration tests for end-to-end comment flow, WebSocket events, and export generation.

### Backend
- Data Models (SQL/NoSQL as appropriate):
  - User: id, name, email, role, preferences.
  - Project: id, name, branding tokens, default settings.
  - Decision: id, project_id, title, status (pending/approved/revoked/needs_changes), created_at, updated_at, approved_by, approved_at, revoked_at.
  - Option: id, decision_id, title, description, media_ids, specs, price, comparison_rank.
  - Media: id, asset_url, type (image/pdf/3d), media_metadata, linked_annotations (array of annotation_ids).
  - Annotation: id, media_id, option_id (nullable), shape_type (point/rect/polygon), coordinates (JSON), created_by, created_at, updated_by, updated_at, note.
  - Comment: id, decision_id, option_id (nullable), parent_id (nullable for threading), author_id, text, mentions (array of user_ids), created_at, updated_at, edited_by, edited_at, status (active/edited/deleted).
  - Notification: id, user_id, type (mention/comment/approval), reference_id, read_at, created_at.
  - ApprovalHistory: id, decision_id, user_id, action (created/approved/rejected/edited), timestamp, details (JSON).
  - Export: id, decision_id, type (pdf/json/csv), generated_at, url.

- APIs (REST or GraphQL):
  - Decisions
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}
    - POST /api/decisions
    - PUT /api/decisions/{id}
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/approve
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/revoke
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}/export
  - Options
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}/options
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/options
  - Media-Annotations
    - POST /api/media/{media_id}/annotations
    - PUT /api/annotations/{id}
    - DELETE /api/annotations/{id}
    - GET /api/media/{media_id}/annotations
  - Comments
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}/comments
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/comments
    - PUT /api/comments/{id}
    - DELETE /api/comments/{id}
  - Mentions & Notifications
    - POST /api/notifications/mention
    - GET /api/notifications?user_id=...
  - Real-time
    - WebSocket channel endpoints for /ws/decisions/{decisionId}
  - Exports
    - GET /api/exports/{export_id}
  - Auth
    - OAuth2 / JWT-based authentication; token validation; role checks.

- Database indexing and constraints:
  - Index on decision_id for comments, annotations; index on media_id; composite indexes for option and decision lookups.
  - Foreign keys: decision -> project; option -> decision; annotation -> media/option; comment -> decision/option/parent; notification -> user.

- Real-time & Messaging:
  - WebSocket channels per decision for comments and annotation updates.
  - Fallback to long-polling if WebSockets unavailable.
  - Debounce rapid comment streams; ensure at-least-once delivery semantics.

- Security:
  - No-login access tokens for client portal with expiration; token rotation.
  - Server-side validation for all inputs; server-side enforcement of business rules (e.g., cannot approve after revoke).
  - Rate limiting on comment POSTs and OTP validation; detect and mitigate abuse.

- Data Integrity & Auditing:
  - Immutable audit entries for approvals and edits; versioning for comments and annotations (with delta diffs if feasible).
  - Export exports reproduce exact state snapshots with timestamps.

### Integration
- Client Portal and Internal Decision Detail both consume the same backend APIs:
  - Shared data models for decisions, options, media, comments, and annotations.
  - Client Portal uses a token-based access path with read/write scoped permissions; Limited comment actions, no admin controls.
  - Internal view uses full permissions (create/edit/delete, export, revoke).

- Branding & Theming:
  - Centralized design tokens for colors, font sizes, spacing, radii.
  - Components should adapt to the brand’s palette and be override-ready for client-specific branding.

- Error Handling:
  - Consistent error payload structure; user-friendly messages; telemetry hooks for errors.

---

## User Experience Flow

1) Client Portal (No-login Link)
- Client opens a shareable link to a decision with side-by-side options.
- Client views media and option details; annotations are visible and can be added by authorized clients if permitted.
- Client adds a comment, optionally mentioning internal team members. Comment appears in real-time or near real-time.
- Client annotates media coordinates to indicate preferences or concerns (where allowed).
- Client can approve or request changes, optionally leaving a short note; action triggers a notification to internal stakeholders.
- If OTP/verification is enabled:
  - Client enters email (if captured) or phone to receive an OTP.
  - Client enters OTP to validate before submitting approval or comments beyond a basic level.
- Notifications: when a new comment or mention appears, the client gets a notification via the chosen channel.

2) Internal Decision Detail (Admin)
- Internal user logs in to /internal/decisions/{decisionId}.
- See the decision overview with status, timestamps, and approval history.
- Open each option to view side-by-side comparisons, related media, and inline annotations.
- View and reply to comments; edit or delete comments within allowed windows; resolve comments if applicable.
- Add annotations to media; modify existing annotations or create new ones; link annotations to specific options if needed.
- Admin actions:
  - Edit decision details, revise option data, or adjust approvals.
  - Revoke approvals with rationale; log revoke reason in ApprovalHistory.
  - Export decision logs to PDF/JSON/CSV; download or share export URL.
- Real-time updates ensure parallel editors see changes instantly.

3) Notifications & Mentions
- Mentions trigger in-app notifications; mention recipients are auto-tagged and alerted.
- Clients and internal users receive notifications about:
  - New comments, replies, or annotations.
  - Status changes (approved, changes requested, revoked).
  - Mentions and upcoming deadlines/reminders.

4) Moderation
- Moderators can edit/delete inappropriate content within allowed windows.
- Moderation logs captured with user and timestamp.

**Never leave users wondering:**
- Skeleton screens matching content layout
- Progress bars for known durations
- Animated placeholders
- Spinners only for short waits (<3s)
- Stagger loading for multiple elements
- Shimmer effects on skeletons

### Empty States
**Make empty states helpful:**
- Illustrations or icons
- Helpful copy explaining why it's empty
- Clear CTA to add first item
- Examples or suggestions
- No "no data" text alone

# Project-Specific Customizations

**IMPORTANT: This section contains the specific design requirements for THIS project. The guidelines above are universal best practices - these customizations below take precedence for project-specific decisions.**

## User Design Requirements

Client Portal and Internal Decision Detail.
  - Card-based, grid layouts, accessible components, responsive behavior (mobile-first).
  - Inline media annotation tools with zoom/pan, scrubber for media timeline (if applicable).
  - Rich text input with mention suggestions, emoji support optional.

---

## Implementation Requirements

### Frontend
- Build a cohesive design system-aligned UI:
  - Reusable React/Vue/Svelte components (Card, Button, Input, Tag, Tabs, MediaViewer, AnnotationOverlay, CommentThread).
  - MediaAnnotationOverlay component capable of rendering shapes, showing metadata, and allowing edits by authorized users.
  - CommentThread component with nested replies, edit/delete windows, mention highlighting, and inline actions (edit, delete, resolve).
  - Side-by-side OptionComparison component: responsive grid that adapts to viewport; shows media, specs, cost, and decision notes per option.
  - Real-time update indicators (typing, new comments, annotation changes).

- Pages:
  - Client Portal (No-login Link):
    - Route: /client-portal/:decisionToken
    - Features: authentication via token, side-by-side comparison, comment composer with mentions, annotation-capable media, approve/change-request actions, optional OTP flow.
  - Decision Detail (Internal):
    - Route: /internal/decisions/:decisionId
    - Features: full decision data, option-by-option annotations, audit trail, export controls, moderation tools, admin actions.

- Accessibility:
  - ARIA roles, keyboard navigable, proper focus management, readable contrast (WCAG 2.1 AA).

- Internationalization:
  - Prepare for i18n (text keys, date/number localization) if needed.

- Performance:
  - Lazy loading of options/media, pagination for comments, efficient annotation rendering for large media.
  - Debounced input for comment typing, optimistic UI updates.

- Mobile-first considerations:
  - Stacked layout with collapsible sections, touch-friendly controls, and large tap targets.

- Testing:
  - Unit tests for models and services, integration tests for end-to-end comment flow, WebSocket events, and export generation.

### Backend
- Data Models (SQL/NoSQL as appropriate):
  - User: id, name, email, role, preferences.
  - Project: id, name, branding tokens, default settings.
  - Decision: id, project_id, title, status (pending/approved/revoked/needs_changes), created_at, updated_at, approved_by, approved_at, revoked_at.
  - Option: id, decision_id, title, description, media_ids, specs, price, comparison_rank.
  - Media: id, asset_url, type (image/pdf/3d), media_metadata, linked_annotations (array of annotation_ids).
  - Annotation: id, media_id, option_id (nullable), shape_type (point/rect/polygon), coordinates (JSON), created_by, created_at, updated_by, updated_at, note.
  - Comment: id, decision_id, option_id (nullable), parent_id (nullable for threading), author_id, text, mentions (array of user_ids), created_at, updated_at, edited_by, edited_at, status (active/edited/deleted).
  - Notification: id, user_id, type (mention/comment/approval), reference_id, read_at, created_at.
  - ApprovalHistory: id, decision_id, user_id, action (created/approved/rejected/edited), timestamp, details (JSON).
  - Export: id, decision_id, type (pdf/json/csv), generated_at, url.

- APIs (REST or GraphQL):
  - Decisions
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}
    - POST /api/decisions
    - PUT /api/decisions/{id}
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/approve
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/revoke

    - PUT /api/comments/{id}
    - DELETE /api/comments/{id}
  - Mentions & Notifications
    - POST /api/notifications/mention
    - GET /api/notifications?user_id=...
  - Real-time
    - WebSocket channel endpoints for /ws/decisions/{decisionId}
  - Exports
    - GET /api/exports/{export_id}
  - Auth
    - OAuth2 / JWT-based authentication; token validation; role checks.

- Database indexing and constraints:
  - Index on decision_id for comments, annotations; index on media_id; composite indexes for option and decision lookups.
  - Foreign keys: decision -> project; option -> decision; annotation -> media/option; comment -> decision/option/parent; notification -> user.

- Real-time & Messaging:
  - WebSocket channels per decision for comments and annotation updates.
  - Fallback to long-polling if WebSockets unavailable.
  - Debounce rapid comment streams; ensure at-least-once delivery semantics.

- Security:
  - No-login access tokens for client portal with expiration; token rotation.
  - Server-side validation for all inputs; server-side enforcement of business rules (e.g., cannot approve after revoke).
  - Rate limiting on comment POSTs and OTP validation; detect and mitigate abuse.

- Data Integrity & Auditing:
  - Immutable audit entries for approvals and edits; versioning for comments and annotations (with delta diffs if feasible).
  - Export exports reproduce exact state snapshots with timestamps.

### Integration
- Client Portal and Internal Decision Detail both consume the same backend APIs:
  - Shared data models for decisions, options, media, comments, and annotations.
  - Client Portal uses a token-based access path with read/write scoped permissions; Limited comment actions, no admin controls.
  - Internal view uses full permissions (create/edit/delete, export, revoke).

- Branding & Theming:
  - Centralized design tokens for colors, font sizes, spacing, radii.
  - Components should adapt to the brand’s palette and be override-ready for client-specific branding.

- Error Handling:
  - Consistent error payload structure; user-friendly messages; telemetry hooks for errors.

---

## User Experience Flow

1) Client Portal (No-login Link)
- Client opens a shareable link to a decision with side-by-side options.
- Client views media and option details; annotations are visible and can be added by authorized clients if permitted.
- Client adds a comment, optionally mentioning internal team members. Comment appears in real-time or near real-time.
- Client annotates media coordinates to indicate preferences or concerns (where allowed).
- Client can approve or request changes, optionally leaving a short note; action triggers a notification to internal stakeholders.
- If OTP/verification is enabled:
  - Client enters email (if captured) or phone to receive an OTP.
  - Client enters OTP to validate before submitting approval or comments beyond a basic level.
- Notifications: when a new comment or mention appears, the client gets a notification via the chosen channel.

2) Internal Decision Detail (Admin)
- Internal user logs in to /internal/decisions/{decisionId}.
- See the decision overview with status, timestamps, and approval history.
- Open each option to view side-by-side comparisons, related media, and inline annotations.
- View and reply to comments; edit or delete comments within allowed windows; resolve comments if applicable.
- Add annotations to media; modify existing annotations or create new ones; link annotations to specific options if needed.
- Admin actions:
  - Edit decision details, revise option data, or adjust approvals.
  - Revoke approvals with rationale; log revoke reason in ApprovalHistory.
  - Export decision logs to PDF/JSON/CSV; download or share export URL.
- Real-time updates ensure parallel editors see changes instantly.

3) Notifications & Mentions
- Mentions trigger in-app notifications; mention recipients are auto-tagged and alerted.
- Clients and internal users receive notifications about:
  - New comments, replies, or annotations.
  - Status changes (approved, changes requested, revoked).
  - Mentions and upcoming deadlines/reminders.

4) Moderation
- Moderators can edit/delete inappropriate content within allowed windows.
- Moderation logs captured with user and timestamp.

 for bestpractices and # Security, Privacy & Compliance

## Overview
Develop a robust Security, Privacy & Compliance module for Archject that provides data governance features including export, retention policies, immutable audit logs, and enterprise privacy controls. Integrate with three connected pages (Admin Dashboard, Settings/Preferences, Project Workspace Page) to ensure admin and end-user workflows support compliance, data portability, visibility into activity, and controlled access. The system must support append-only audit logs, PACS/SOC2/ISO roadmap alignment, encryption at rest and in transit, and policy-driven data retention with automatic archiving or deletion. Deliver a cohesive UI consistent with Archject’s design system, enabling administrators to monitor platform health, manage accounts, and enforce privacy controls while keeping project-level decisions auditable and exportable.

## Components to Build
- Data Governance Core
  - Immutable audit trail (append-only) capturing admin actions, approvals, and decision events.
  - Data export engine: generate downloadable archives (e.g., ZIP/TIFO equivalents) of workspace data and decision logs, stored in S3-compatible object storage.
  - Retention Policy Engine: workspace-level retention settings with auto-archiving and deletion, scheduling, and legal hold support.
  - Encryption and Security Controls: handle encryption at rest (DB, S3) and in transit; expose SOC2/ISO controls roadmap artifacts.
  - Enterprise Privacy Controls: access controls, data masking, export controls, and data ownership management per workspace/account.
- Admin Dashboard (page_admin)
  - Platform-wide admin controls for user provisioning, billing, usage monitoring, system health, audit log exploration, export jobs, retention policy configurations, and data export status.
- Settings / Preferences (page_settings)
  - Account and workspace settings: billing, branding, notification preferences, integrations, API keys, workspace data export, retention policies, export schedules, and privacy controls.
- Project Workspace Page (page_project)
  - Project-level workspace with visual decision logs, project files, team members, templates, and a project overview that includes branding, privacy/compliance settings, and retention posture per project.
- UI Analytics & Telemetry
  - Dashboards and reports for audit logs, export activity, retention metrics, and policy compliance status.

  - Data integrity checks: checksums for exported archives; audit-log hash chaining verification.

### Integration
- Connect Frontend to Backend via REST/GraphQL (choose one; ensure consistency).
- Ensure audit log events are emitted for every admin, export, retention action, and decision change; all actions should appear in Admin Dashboard and Project Workspace audit trails.
- Data Export flow:
  - User triggers export; system validates scope; export job created; when complete, secure URL provided and notification emitted.
  - Stored exports reference workspace/project scope; access is restricted based on user permissions.
- Retention flow:
  - Policy definitions applied at workspace level; devices and services trigger archiving or deletion; archived content becomes read-only with retention stamps.
- Privacy Controls flow:
  - Masking rules applied on export and display; access request lifecycle tracked in audit logs.
- Admin Dashboard integration:
  - Health checks, audit log search, export job monitoring, retention policy statistics, and privacy compliance status widgets.
- Project Workspace integration:
  - Decisions, files, and team data linked to retention and export policies; project-level privacy controls inherited from workspace with overrides.

## User Experience Flow
1. Admin logs in to Admin Dashboard.
2. Enters System Health panel to review uptime, latency, and errors.
3. Opens Audit Logs Explorer, filters by date range and user, confirms immutable entries exist for actions.
4. Initiates a Data Export Job for a workspace; selects scope (decisions, logs, files); monitors progress; downloads archive from S3.
5. Creates/Updates Retention Policy for a workspace; sets duration and action (archive or delete); enables legal hold if needed.
6. Configures Privacy Controls for a workspace: masking rules, data categories, and access policies.
7. Navigates to Settings / Preferences; adjusts billing, branding, integrations (S3 target), and API keys; configures export schedules.
8. Visits Project Workspace Page; views project overview, decision boards, and files; ensures project branding and privacy controls align with policy.
9. Creates a new decision; triggers an audit log entry; approves decision; audit trail updates and related notifications fire.
10. Initiates per-project export; system applies project-level retention, archives as configured, and exports are delivered to the customer portal or S3.

# Security, Privacy & Compliance

## Overview
Develop a robust Security, Privacy & Compliance module for Archject that provides data governance features including export, retention policies, immutable audit logs, and enterprise privacy controls. Integrate with three connected pages (Admin Dashboard, Settings/Preferences, Project Workspace Page) to ensure admin and end-user workflows support compliance, data portability, visibility into activity, and controlled access. The system must support append-only audit logs, PACS/SOC2/ISO roadmap alignment, encryption at rest and in transit, and policy-driven data retention with automatic archiving or deletion. Deliver a cohesive UI consistent with Archject’s design system, enabling administrators to monitor platform health, manage accounts, and enforce privacy controls while keeping project-level decisions auditable and exportable.

## Components to Build
- Data Governance Core
  - Immutable audit trail (append-only) capturing admin actions, approvals, and decision events.
  - Data export engine: generate downloadable archives (e.g., ZIP/TIFO equivalents) of workspace data and decision logs, stored in S3-compatible object storage.
  - Retention Policy Engine: workspace-level retention settings with auto-archiving and deletion, scheduling, and legal hold support.
  - Encryption and Security Controls: handle encryption at rest (DB, S3) and in transit; expose SOC2/ISO controls roadmap artifacts.
  - Enterprise Privacy Controls: access controls, data masking, export controls, and data ownership management per workspace/account.
- Admin Dashboard (page_admin)
  - Platform-wide admin controls for user provisioning, billing, usage monitoring, system health, audit log exploration, export jobs, retention policy configurations, and data export status.
- Settings / Preferences (page_settings)
  - Account and workspace settings: billing, branding, notification preferences, integrations, API keys, workspace data export, retention policies, export schedules, and privacy controls.
- Project Workspace Page (page_project)
  - Project-level workspace with visual decision logs, project files, team members, templates, and a project overview that includes branding, privacy/compliance settings, and retention posture per project.
- UI Analytics & Telemetry
  - Dashboards and reports for audit logs, export activity, retention metrics, and policy compliance status.

  - Project API: decision logging, files management, and project-level branding/settings read/write.
  - Integrations API: configure S3 buckets, identity providers, webhooks.
- Data Models (Core)
  - AuditLog: id (UUID), workspace_id, project_id (nullable), user_id, action, resource, target_id, timestamp, ip_address, device, immutable_hash, additional_context JSON.
  - DataExportJob: id, workspace_id, format, status (queued, running, completed, failed), created_at, completed_at, s3_key, policy_id, user_id, scope JSON.
  - RetentionPolicy: id, workspace_id, policy_name, mode (archive/delete), duration_days, schedule_cron, criteria (live/archived/deleted), legal_hold boolean, created_at, updated_at.

- Data Storage
  - Immutable audit logs stored in append-only manner (e.g., write-ahead log or immutable table) with cryptographic hash chaining.
  - Exports stored as archives in S3-compatible storage; manifest stored in DB with pointer to S3 object.
  - Encryption at rest: DB encryption (e.g., TDE), S3 server-side encryption; TLS in transit for all endpoints.
- Scheduling & Workers
  - Retention policy engine workers to archive/delete based on policy and legal holds.
  - Job workers for export generation, masking/redaction, and notification triggers.
- Security
  - Authentication: OAuth2/OIDC, session tokens with short lifetimes.
  - Authorization: RBAC with per-workspace scoping; admin vs. user with granular permissions.
  - Audit integrity: cryptographic signing of logs, tamper-evident storage, and immutable rotation policies.
  - Compliance roadmap artifacts: store SOC2/ISO alignment artifacts as static documents with versioning and audit visibility.
- Validation & Integrity
  - Input validation for all endpoints; strict schemas for request bodies; allowed list of fields for export and masking.
  - Data integrity checks: checksums for exported archives; audit-log hash chaining verification.

### Integration
- Connect Frontend to Backend via REST/GraphQL (choose one; ensure consistency).
- Ensure audit log events are emitted for every admin, export, retention action, and decision change; all actions should appear in Admin Dashboard and Project Workspace audit trails.
- Data Export flow:
  - User triggers export; system validates scope; export job created; when complete, secure URL provided and notification emitted.
  - Stored exports reference workspace/project scope; access is restricted based on user permissions.
- Retention flow:
  - Policy definitions applied at workspace level; devices and services trigger archiving or deletion; archived content becomes read-only with retention stamps.
- Privacy Controls flow:
  - Masking rules applied on export and display; access request lifecycle tracked in audit logs.
- Admin Dashboard integration:
  - Health checks, audit log search, export job monitoring, retention policy statistics, and privacy compliance status widgets.
- Project Workspace integration:
  - Decisions, files, and team data linked to retention and export policies; project-level privacy controls inherited from workspace with overrides.

## User Experience Flow
1. Admin logs in to Admin Dashboard.
2. Enters System Health panel to review uptime, latency, and errors.
3. Opens Audit Logs Explorer, filters by date range and user, confirms immutable entries exist for actions.
4. Initiates a Data Export Job for a workspace; selects scope (decisions, logs, files); monitors progress; downloads archive from S3.
5. Creates/Updates Retention Policy for a workspace; sets duration and action (archive or delete); enables legal hold if needed.
6. Configures Privacy Controls for a workspace: masking rules, data categories, and access policies.
7. Navigates to Settings / Preferences; adjusts billing, branding, integrations (S3 target), and API keys; configures export schedules.
8. Visits Project Workspace Page; views project overview, decision boards, and files; ensures project branding and privacy controls align with policy.
9. Creates a new decision; triggers an audit log entry; approves decision; audit trail updates and related notifications fire.
10. Initiates per-project export; system applies project-level retention, archives as configured, and exports are delivered to the customer portal or S3.
