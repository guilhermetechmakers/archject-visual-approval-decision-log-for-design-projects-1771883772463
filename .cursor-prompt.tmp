# Modern Design Best Practices

## Philosophy

Create unique, memorable experiences while maintaining consistency through modern design principles. Every project should feel distinct yet professional, innovative yet intuitive.

---

## Landing Pages & Marketing Sites

### Hero Sections
**Go beyond static backgrounds:**
- Animated gradients with subtle movement
- Particle systems or geometric shapes floating
- Interactive canvas backgrounds (Three.js, WebGL)
- Video backgrounds with proper fallbacks
- Parallax scrolling effects
- Gradient mesh animations
- Morphing blob animations


### Layout Patterns
**Use modern grid systems:**
- Bento grids (asymmetric card layouts)
- Masonry layouts for varied content
- Feature sections with diagonal cuts or curves
- Overlapping elements with proper z-index
- Split-screen designs with scroll-triggered reveals

**Avoid:** Traditional 3-column equal grids

### Scroll Animations
**Engage users as they scroll:**
- Fade-in and slide-up animations for sections
- Scroll-triggered parallax effects
- Progress indicators for long pages
- Sticky elements that transform on scroll
- Horizontal scroll sections for portfolios
- Text reveal animations (word by word, letter by letter)
- Number counters animating into view

**Avoid:** Static pages with no scroll interaction

### Call-to-Action Areas
**Make CTAs impossible to miss:**
- Gradient buttons with hover effects
- Floating action buttons with micro-interactions
- Animated borders or glowing effects
- Scale/lift on hover
- Interactive elements that respond to mouse position
- Pulsing indicators for primary actions

---

## Dashboard Applications

### Layout Structure
**Always use collapsible side navigation:**
- Sidebar that can collapse to icons only
- Smooth transition animations between states
- Persistent navigation state (remember user preference)
- Mobile: drawer that slides in/out
- Desktop: sidebar with expand/collapse toggle
- Icons visible even when collapsed

**Structure:**
```
/dashboard (layout wrapper with sidebar)
  /dashboard/overview
  /dashboard/analytics
  /dashboard/settings
  /dashboard/users
  /dashboard/projects
```

All dashboard pages should be nested inside the dashboard layout, not separate routes.

### Data Tables
**Modern table design:**
- Sticky headers on scroll
- Row hover states with subtle elevation
- Sortable columns with clear indicators
- Pagination with items-per-page control
- Search/filter with instant feedback
- Selection checkboxes with bulk actions
- Responsive: cards on mobile, table on desktop
- Loading skeletons, not spinners
- Empty states with illustrations or helpful text

**Use modern table libraries:**
- TanStack Table (React Table v8)
- AG Grid for complex data
- Data Grid from MUI (if using MUI)

### Charts & Visualizations
**Use the latest charting libraries:**
- Recharts (for React, simple charts)
- Chart.js v4 (versatile, well-maintained)
- Apache ECharts (advanced, interactive)
- D3.js (custom, complex visualizations)
- Tremor (for dashboards, built on Recharts)

**Chart best practices:**
- Animated transitions when data changes
- Interactive tooltips with detailed info
- Responsive sizing
- Color scheme matching design system
- Legend placement that doesn't obstruct data
- Loading states while fetching data

### Dashboard Cards
**Metric cards should stand out:**
- Gradient backgrounds or colored accents
- Trend indicators (↑ ↓ with color coding)
- Sparkline charts for historical data
- Hover effects revealing more detail
- Icon representing the metric
- Comparison to previous period

---

## Color & Visual Design

### Color Palettes
**Create depth with gradients:**
- Primary gradient (not just solid primary color)
- Subtle background gradients
- Gradient text for headings
- Gradient borders on cards
- Elevated surfaces for depth

**Color usage:**
- 60-30-10 rule (dominant, secondary, accent)
- Consistent semantic colors (success, warning, error)
- Accessible contrast ratios (WCAG AA minimum)

### Typography
**Create hierarchy through contrast:**
- Large, bold headings (48-72px for heroes)
- Clear size differences between levels
- Variable font weights (300, 400, 600, 700)
- Letter spacing for small caps
- Line height 1.5-1.7 for body text
- Inter, Poppins, or DM Sans for modern feel

### Shadows & Depth
**Layer UI elements:**
- Multi-layer shadows for realistic depth
- Colored shadows matching element color
- Elevated states on hover
- Neumorphism for special elements (sparingly)

---

## Interactions & Micro-animations

### Button Interactions
**Every button should react:**
- Scale slightly on hover (1.02-1.05)
- Lift with shadow on hover
- Ripple effect on click
- Loading state with spinner or progress
- Disabled state clearly visible
- Success state with checkmark animation

### Card Interactions
**Make cards feel alive:**
- Lift on hover with increased shadow
- Subtle border glow on hover
- Tilt effect following mouse (3D transform)
- Smooth transitions (200-300ms)
- Click feedback for interactive cards

### Form Interactions
**Guide users through forms:**
- Input focus states with border color change
- Floating labels that animate up
- Real-time validation with inline messages
- Success checkmarks for valid inputs
- Error states with shake animation
- Password strength indicators
- Character count for text areas

### Page Transitions
**Smooth between views:**
- Fade + slide for page changes
- Skeleton loaders during data fetch
- Optimistic UI updates
- Stagger animations for lists
- Route transition animations

---

## Mobile Responsiveness

### Mobile-First Approach
**Design for mobile, enhance for desktop:**
- Touch targets minimum 44x44px
- Generous padding and spacing
- Sticky bottom navigation on mobile
- Collapsible sections for long content
- Swipeable cards and galleries
- Pull-to-refresh where appropriate

### Responsive Patterns
**Adapt layouts intelligently:**
- Hamburger menu → full nav bar
- Card grid → stack on mobile
- Sidebar → drawer
- Multi-column → single column
- Data tables → card list
- Hide/show elements based on viewport

---

## Loading & Empty States

### Loading States
**Never leave users wondering:**
- Skeleton screens matching content layout
- Progress bars for known durations
- Animated placeholders
- Spinners only for short waits (<3s)
- Stagger loading for multiple elements
- Shimmer effects on skeletons

### Empty States
**Make empty states helpful:**
- Illustrations or icons
- Helpful copy explaining why it's empty
- Clear CTA to add first item
- Examples or suggestions
- No "no data" text alone

---

## Unique Elements to Stand Out

### Distinctive Features
**Add personality:**
- Custom cursor effects on landing pages
- Animated page numbers or section indicators
- Unusual hover effects (magnification, distortion)
- Custom scrollbars
- Glassmorphism for overlays
- Animated SVG icons
- Typewriter effects for hero text

 for bestpractices and # Cookie Policy

## Overview
Create a self-contained Cookie Policy page that explains the cookies used on the site and provides per-category opt-in/out toggles for marketing cookies. The page should be visually consistent with the Archject design system, accessible, responsive, and capable of recording consent changes in a simple audit trail. No external APIs are required for this task.

## Page Description (Full Detail)
What this page is:
- A dedicated Cookie Policy page that explains what cookies are used on the site, categorized into necessary, analytics, marketing, and preferences, with per-category consent toggles specifically for marketing cookies.

Goals:
- Clearly disclose cookie categories and purposes.
- Provide per-category opt-in/out toggles, with marketing cookies being user-controllable.
- Display a Change History section that records consent changes with timestamp, category, and action (opt-in/opt-out).
- Ensure accessibility (keyboard navigable, screen-reader friendly) and mobile-first responsive design.
- Integrate with the existing design system for typography, colors, spacing, and UI components.
- Persist user consent preferences locally (e.g., in localStorage) and provide a simple API surface for exporting consent state if needed (no external API integration required).

Connected features:
- This page stores user consent state locally and may feed into future integrations (e.g., enabling/disabling analytics or marketing scripts). Current scope does not require enabling/disabling actual third-party cookies, but the UI must support that in the future.

UI elements and visual guidance:
- Cookie Categories: necessary, analytics, marketing, preferences.
- Consent Toggles: per-category toggle for marketing cookies (and a read-only indicator for categories that are always on/off due to necessity).
- Change History: a compact, readable log of consent changes with date/time, category affected, and action.
- Summary banner or badge indicating current consent status overview (e.g., “Marketing cookies enabled/disabled”).
- Clear action area with primary button to “Save Preferences” (or “Accept All” as an optional broader action depending on UX choice) and secondary actions like “Reset to Defaults.”
- Cards and sections styled with the project’s card design, consistent typography, and subtle shadows.
- Visual guidance: maintain a calm, minimal look with soft grays, deep green accents for primary actions, and status indicators using the specified color palette.

API integrations:
- No external APIs required.
- Data persistence via localStorage (or the project’s existing client-side state management if available).

## Components to Build
- CookiePolicyPage: Main container for the page with header, content sections, and footer actions.
- CategoryCard: Reusable component for each cookie category showing name, description, and toggle (disabled for necessary).
- ConsentToggle: Accessible switch control with ARIA attributes, keyboard support, and visual states for on/off.
- ChangeHistoryTable: Readable table/list showing timestamp, category, and action (opt-in/opt-out).
- SummaryPanel: Small, at-a-glance overview of current consent state per category.
- SaveBar: Action bar with primary and secondary actions (Save, Accept All, Reset).
- LocalStorageService (Frontend): Utility to save/load consent state, and to record change events.
- AuditTrailLogger: Simple in-memory or persistent (localStorage) logger to generate Change History entries.

## Implementation Requirements

### Frontend
- UI Components:
  - Implement Card components with the specified shadow, border radius, hover behavior, and padding (24px min).
  - Implement Pill-shaped Top Navigation and any necessary page chrome consistent with Archject.
  - Implement Toggle switches that are accessible (role="switch", aria-checked) and keyboard navigable.
  - Implement a responsive grid layout: content cards stack on small viewports and use columns on larger viewports.
  - Implement a Change History section with a clean list/table, supporting sorting if required in future.
  - Implement a Status/Consent Summary badge area with color cues for each category.
- Interactions:
  - Initialize with default consent: necessary category always on; others default to off unless previously stored.
  - Toggling a category updates in-page state, optionally shows a brief micro-interaction (e.g., ripple/scale on button/icon presses).
  - Save Preferences persists to localStorage and appends a Change History entry with timestamp, category, and action.
  - Reset defaults reverts all non-necessary categories to their default states and logs the change.
  - Accept All action (if included) toggles all non-necessary categories to on and saves with a single Change History entry per category or a single aggregated entry depending on UX choice.
- Accessibility:
  - All inputs have labels; color contrast meets WCAG AA for text and UI elements.
  - Focus states are clearly visible with a focus ring.
  - Screen reader-friendly semantics: meaningful headings, descriptive aria-labels, and live regions for consent status updates if needed.
- Performance:
  - Lightweight, no unnecessary re-renders. Debounce save operations if needed.
- Styling:
  - Use the provided color palette and typography system. Cards, shadows, borders, and spacing align with the design system.
  - Typography: Inter (or equivalent) with specified weights: 400 body, 500 labels/navigation, 600 headings/actions.
  - Spacing: 8px base increments; container padding 24-32px; gaps 16-24px.
  - Visual treatment for inactive toggles should be muted; active toggles should use the brand green and a prominent label.

### Backend
- No backend APIs required for this task.
- If the project includes a backend in the future, prepare a simple contract:
  - API Endpoints (placeholder): GET /consent (retrieve stored preferences), POST /consent (update preferences with delta), GET /consent/history (retrieve change history). These can be stubbed for future integration.
- Data storage:
  - Persist in localStorage with a schema like:
    {
      consent: {
        necessary: true,
        analytics: false,
        marketing: false,
        preferences: false
      },
      history: [
        { timestamp: 2026-02-23T12:34:56Z, category: 'marketing', action: 'opt-in' },
        ...
      ]
    }

### Integration
- Client-side state management:
  - Integrate with existing global state if present; otherwise local component state with a tiny store to ensure persistence across page reloads.
- Design system consistency:
  - Reuse existing Card, Button, Toggle, and Typography primitives to ensure consistency.
- Data layer isolation:
  - The Cookie Policy page should not depend on any external API. Isolation ensures predictable behavior in offline or test environments.

## User Experience Flow
1. User lands on the Cookie Policy page.
2. Page header explains the purpose: “Explain cookies used on this site and manage consent for marketing cookies.”
3. The page displays categories in cards:
   - Necessary: Always active, cannot be toggled; shows a brief rationale.
   - Analytics: Toggle (off by default if no prior consent).
   - Marketing: Toggle (off by default if no prior consent).
   - Preferences: Toggle (off by default if no prior consent).
4. User can toggle Marketing, Analytics, and Preferences on/off.
5. A Summary Panel shows current status for each category with color cues.
6. Change History lists prior consent changes with timestamps.
7. User clicks Save Preferences to persist state to localStorage; a brief success indicator appears.
8. User may click Reset to Defaults to revert to the initial state.
9. Optional: User clicks Accept All to enable all non-necessary categories; state updates accordingly and logs changes.
10. If the user revisits the page, previously saved preferences are loaded and reflected in the UI; Change History continues to accumulate as actions occur.

## Technical Specifications
- Data Models:
  - ConsentState:
    - necessary: true
    - analytics: boolean
    - marketing: boolean
    - preferences: boolean
  - ChangeHistoryEntry:
    - timestamp: string (ISO 8601)
    - category: string ('analytics'|'marketing'|'preferences')
    - action: string ('opt-in'|'opt-out')
- API Endpoints:
  - Not required for this task, but prepare the following placeholder for future:
    - GET /consent -> { consent, history }
    - POST /consent -> { success }
    - GET /consent/history -> { history }
- Security:
  - Local-only data; no authentication required. If integrating with backend, ensure endpoints are protected and respect user data ownership.
- Validation:
  - Toggles for non-necessary categories are boolean.
  - History entries timestamp must be valid ISO strings; ensure state is serializable to JSON.

## Acceptance Criteria
- UI renders with all sections: header, four category cards (three togglable, one non-togglable), Change History, and a Summary Panel.
- Non-necessary category (necessary) is displayed as active/locked (not toggle-able).
- Toggling a category updates UI state immediately and logs a Change History entry upon Save.
- Save Preferences persists to localStorage and reloads correctly on page refresh.
- Reset to Defaults restores initial state and logs appropriate Change History entries.
- Accessibility: all controls are keyboard accessible with proper aria labels; color contrast meets WCAG AA.

## UI/UX Guidelines
Apply the project's design system:
- Buttons: Primary actions use deep green (#195C4A); secondary actions use softer variants.
- Toggles: Accessible switches with clear on/off states.
- Cards: White backgrounds, soft shadows, 12-16px radii, 24px padding minimum.
- Typography: Inter-like font; 400 body, 500 labels, 600 headings/actions.
- Layout: Wide grid with 24-32px container padding; 8px spacing increments; left-aligned content; responsive stacking on small viewports.
- Navigation: If a top nav or sidebar exists in the app, ensure the Cookie Policy page integrates seamlessly; use existing typography and color tokens.

## Visual Style

### Color Palette (reiterated)
- Primary: #FFFFFF (backgrounds)
- Secondary: #F5F6FA, #F7F8FA
- Accent Colors:
  - Deep green: #195C4A (active nav, primary actions)

- Persist user consent preferences locally (e.g., in localStorage) and provide a simple API surface for exporting consent state if needed (no external API integration required).

Connected features:
- This page stores user consent state locally and may feed into future integrations (e.g., enabling/disabling analytics or marketing scripts). Current scope does not require enabling/disabling actual third-party cookies, but the UI must support that in the future.

UI elements and visual guidance:
- Cookie Categories: necessary, analytics, marketing, preferences.
- Consent Toggles: per-category toggle for marketing cookies (and a read-only indicator for categories that are always on/off due to necessity).
- Change History: a compact, readable log of consent changes with date/time, category affected, and action.
- Summary banner or badge indicating current consent status overview (e.g., “Marketing cookies enabled/disabled”).
- Clear action area with primary button to “Save Preferences” (or “Accept All” as an optional broader action depending on UX choice) and secondary actions like “Reset to Defaults.”
- Cards and sections styled with the project’s card design, consistent typography, and subtle shadows.
- Visual guidance: maintain a calm, minimal look with soft grays, deep green accents for primary actions, and status indicators using the specified color palette.

API integrations:
- No external APIs required.
- Data persistence via localStorage (or the project’s existing client-side state management if available).

## Components to Build
- CookiePolicyPage: Main container for the page with header, content sections, and footer actions.
- CategoryCard: Reusable component for each cookie category showing name, description, and toggle (disabled for necessary).
- ConsentToggle: Accessible switch control with ARIA attributes, keyboard support, and visual states for on/off.
- ChangeHistoryTable: Readable table/list showing timestamp, category, and action (opt-in/opt-out).
- SummaryPanel: Small, at-a-glance overview of current consent state per category.
- SaveBar: Action bar with primary and secondary actions (Save, Accept All, Reset).
- LocalStorageService (Frontend): Utility to save/load consent state, and to record change events.
- AuditTrailLogger: Simple in-memory or persistent (localStorage) logger to generate Change History entries.

## Implementation Requirements

### Frontend
- UI Components:
  - Implement Card components with the specified shadow, border radius, hover behavior, and padding (24px min).
  - Implement Pill-shaped Top Navigation and any necessary page chrome consistent with Archject.
  - Implement Toggle switches that are accessible (role="switch", aria-checked) and keyboard navigable.
  - Implement a responsive grid layout: content cards stack on small viewports and use columns on larger viewports.
  - Implement a Change History section with a clean list/table, supporting sorting if required in future.
  - Implement a Status/Consent Summary badge area with color cues for each category.
- Interactions:
  - Initialize with default consent: necessary category always on; others default to off unless previously stored.
  - Toggling a category updates in-page state, optionally shows a brief micro-interaction (e.g., ripple/scale on button/icon presses).
  - Save Preferences persists to localStorage and appends a Change History entry with timestamp, category, and action.
  - Reset defaults reverts all non-necessary categories to their default states and logs the change.
  - Accept All action (if included) toggles all non-necessary categories to on and saves with a single Change History entry per category or a single aggregated entry depending on UX choice.
- Accessibility:
  - All inputs have labels; color contrast meets WCAG AA for text and UI elements.
  - Focus states are clearly visible with a focus ring.
  - Screen reader-friendly semantics: meaningful headings, descriptive aria-labels, and live regions for consent status updates if needed.
- Performance:
  - Lightweight, no unnecessary re-renders. Debounce save operations if needed.
- Styling:
  - Use the provided color palette and typography system. Cards, shadows, borders, and spacing align with the design system.
  - Typography: Inter (or equivalent) with specified weights: 400 body, 500 labels/navigation, 600 headings/actions.
  - Spacing: 8px base increments; container padding 24-32px; gaps 16-24px.
  - Visual treatment for inactive toggles should be muted; active toggles should use the brand green and a prominent label.

### Backend
- No backend APIs required for this task.
- If the project includes a backend in the future, prepare a simple contract:
  - API Endpoints (placeholder): GET /consent (retrieve stored preferences), POST /consent (update preferences with delta), GET /consent/history (retrieve change history). These can be stubbed for future integration.
- Data storage:
  - Persist in localStorage with a schema like:
    {
      consent: {
        necessary: true,
        analytics: false,
        marketing: false,
        preferences: false
      },
      history: [
        { timestamp: 2026-02-23T12:34:56Z, category: 'marketing', action: 'opt-in' },
        ...
      ]
    }

### Integration
- Client-side state management:
  - Integrate with existing global state if present; otherwise local component state with a tiny store to ensure persistence across page reloads.
- Design system consistency:
  - Reuse existing Card, Button, Toggle, and Typography primitives to ensure consistency.
- Data layer isolation:
  - The Cookie Policy page should not depend on any external API. Isolation ensures predictable behavior in offline or test environments.

## User Experience Flow
1. User lands on the Cookie Policy page.
2. Page header explains the purpose: “Explain cookies used on this site and manage consent for marketing cookies.”
3. The page displays categories in cards:
   - Necessary: Always active, cannot be toggled; shows a brief rationale.
   - Analytics: Toggle (off by default if no prior consent).
   - Marketing: Toggle (off by default if no prior consent).
   - Preferences: Toggle (off by default if no prior consent).
4. User can toggle Marketing, Analytics, and Preferences on/off.
5. A Summary Panel shows current status for each category with color cues.
6. Change History lists prior consent changes with timestamps.
7. User clicks Save Preferences to persist state to localStorage; a brief success indicator appears.
8. User may click Reset to Defaults to revert to the initial state.
9. Optional: User clicks Accept All to enable all non-necessary categories; state updates accordingly and logs changes.
10. If the user revisits the page, previously saved preferences are loaded and reflected in the UI; Change History continues to accumulate as actions occur.

## Technical Specifications
- Data Models:
  - ConsentState:
    - necessary: true
    - analytics: boolean
    - marketing: boolean
    - preferences: boolean
  - ChangeHistoryEntry:
    - timestamp: string (ISO 8601)
    - category: string ('analytics'|'marketing'|'preferences')
    - action: string ('opt-in'|'opt-out')
- API Endpoints:
  - Not required for this task, but prepare the following placeholder for future:
    - GET /consent -> { consent, history }
    - POST /consent -> { success }
    - GET /consent/history -> { history }
- Security:
  - Local-only data; no authentication required. If integrating with backend, ensure endpoints are protected and respect user data ownership.
- Validation:
  - Toggles for non-necessary categories are boolean.
  - History entries timestamp must be valid ISO strings; ensure state is serializable to JSON.

## Acceptance Criteria
- UI renders with all sections: header, four category cards (three togglable, one non-togglable), Change History, and a Summary Panel.
- Non-necessary category (necessary) is displayed as active/locked (not toggle-able).
- Toggling a category updates UI state immediately and logs a Change History entry upon Save.
- Save Preferences persists to localStorage and reloads correctly on page refresh.
- Reset to Defaults restores initial state and logs appropriate Change History entries.
- Accessibility: all controls are keyboard accessible with proper aria labels; color contrast meets WCAG AA.

## UI/UX Guidelines
Apply the project's design system:
- Buttons: Primary actions use deep green (#195C4A); secondary actions use softer variants.
- Toggles: Accessible switches with clear on/off states.
- Cards: White backgrounds, soft shadows, 12-16px radii, 24px padding minimum.
- Typography: Inter-like font; 400 body, 500 labels, 600 headings/actions.
- Layout: Wide grid with 24-32px container padding; 8px spacing increments; left-aligned content; responsive stacking on small viewports.
- Navigation: If a top nav or sidebar exists in the app, ensure the Cookie Policy page integrates seamlessly; use existing typography and color tokens.

## Visual Style

### Color Palette (reiterated)
- Primary: #FFFFFF (backgrounds)
- Secondary: #F5F6FA, #F7F8FA
- Accent Colors:
  - Deep green: #195C4A (active nav, primary actions)
  - Bright green: #7BE495 (success/status)

- Weights: 400, 500, 600
- Hierarchy: Large headings, medium subheaders, regular body
- Layout: 24-32px container padding, 16-24px gaps, 8px increments

### Key Design Elements
- Card Design: White cards, subtle shadows, 12-16px radius, 24px internal padding, hover elevation.
- Navigation: Top nav with pill-shaped tabs; active state in #195C4A; focus rings; large hit areas.
- Data Visualization: N/A in this task (no charts required), but maintain card styling for consistency if history uses a small inline badge.
- Interactive Elements: Pill buttons, toggles, hover states, focus states, status tags.

### Design Philosophy
- Modern, minimalist, professional; clarity, accessibility, trust; mobile-friendly; consistent with Archject brand.
