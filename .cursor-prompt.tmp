# Project-Specific Customizations

**IMPORTANT: This section contains the specific design requirements for THIS project. The guidelines above are universal best practices - these customizations below take precedence for project-specific decisions.**

## User Design Requirements

Client Portal and Internal Decision Detail.
  - Card-based, grid layouts, accessible components, responsive behavior (mobile-first).
  - Inline media annotation tools with zoom/pan, scrubber for media timeline (if applicable).
  - Rich text input with mention suggestions, emoji support optional.

---

## Implementation Requirements

### Frontend
- Build a cohesive design system-aligned UI:
  - Reusable React/Vue/Svelte components (Card, Button, Input, Tag, Tabs, MediaViewer, AnnotationOverlay, CommentThread).
  - MediaAnnotationOverlay component capable of rendering shapes, showing metadata, and allowing edits by authorized users.
  - CommentThread component with nested replies, edit/delete windows, mention highlighting, and inline actions (edit, delete, resolve).
  - Side-by-side OptionComparison component: responsive grid that adapts to viewport; shows media, specs, cost, and decision notes per option.
  - Real-time update indicators (typing, new comments, annotation changes).

- Pages:
  - Client Portal (No-login Link):
    - Route: /client-portal/:decisionToken
    - Features: authentication via token, side-by-side comparison, comment composer with mentions, annotation-capable media, approve/change-request actions, optional OTP flow.
  - Decision Detail (Internal):
    - Route: /internal/decisions/:decisionId
    - Features: full decision data, option-by-option annotations, audit trail, export controls, moderation tools, admin actions.

- Accessibility:
  - ARIA roles, keyboard navigable, proper focus management, readable contrast (WCAG 2.1 AA).

- Internationalization:
  - Prepare for i18n (text keys, date/number localization) if needed.

- Performance:
  - Lazy loading of options/media, pagination for comments, efficient annotation rendering for large media.
  - Debounced input for comment typing, optimistic UI updates.

- Mobile-first considerations:
  - Stacked layout with collapsible sections, touch-friendly controls, and large tap targets.

- Testing:
  - Unit tests for models and services, integration tests for end-to-end comment flow, WebSocket events, and export generation.

### Backend
- Data Models (SQL/NoSQL as appropriate):
  - User: id, name, email, role, preferences.
  - Project: id, name, branding tokens, default settings.
  - Decision: id, project_id, title, status (pending/approved/revoked/needs_changes), created_at, updated_at, approved_by, approved_at, revoked_at.
  - Option: id, decision_id, title, description, media_ids, specs, price, comparison_rank.
  - Media: id, asset_url, type (image/pdf/3d), media_metadata, linked_annotations (array of annotation_ids).
  - Annotation: id, media_id, option_id (nullable), shape_type (point/rect/polygon), coordinates (JSON), created_by, created_at, updated_by, updated_at, note.
  - Comment: id, decision_id, option_id (nullable), parent_id (nullable for threading), author_id, text, mentions (array of user_ids), created_at, updated_at, edited_by, edited_at, status (active/edited/deleted).
  - Notification: id, user_id, type (mention/comment/approval), reference_id, read_at, created_at.
  - ApprovalHistory: id, decision_id, user_id, action (created/approved/rejected/edited), timestamp, details (JSON).
  - Export: id, decision_id, type (pdf/json/csv), generated_at, url.

- APIs (REST or GraphQL):
  - Decisions
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}
    - POST /api/decisions
    - PUT /api/decisions/{id}
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/approve
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/revoke
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}/export
  - Options
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}/options
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/options
  - Media-Annotations
    - POST /api/media/{media_id}/annotations
    - PUT /api/annotations/{id}
    - DELETE /api/annotations/{id}
    - GET /api/media/{media_id}/annotations
  - Comments
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}/comments
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/comments
    - PUT /api/comments/{id}
    - DELETE /api/comments/{id}
  - Mentions & Notifications
    - POST /api/notifications/mention
    - GET /api/notifications?user_id=...
  - Real-time
    - WebSocket channel endpoints for /ws/decisions/{decisionId}
  - Exports
    - GET /api/exports/{export_id}
  - Auth
    - OAuth2 / JWT-based authentication; token validation; role checks.

- Database indexing and constraints:
  - Index on decision_id for comments, annotations; index on media_id; composite indexes for option and decision lookups.
  - Foreign keys: decision -> project; option -> decision; annotation -> media/option; comment -> decision/option/parent; notification -> user.

- Real-time & Messaging:
  - WebSocket channels per decision for comments and annotation updates.
  - Fallback to long-polling if WebSockets unavailable.
  - Debounce rapid comment streams; ensure at-least-once delivery semantics.

- Security:
  - No-login access tokens for client portal with expiration; token rotation.
  - Server-side validation for all inputs; server-side enforcement of business rules (e.g., cannot approve after revoke).
  - Rate limiting on comment POSTs and OTP validation; detect and mitigate abuse.

- Data Integrity & Auditing:
  - Immutable audit entries for approvals and edits; versioning for comments and annotations (with delta diffs if feasible).
  - Export exports reproduce exact state snapshots with timestamps.

### Integration
- Client Portal and Internal Decision Detail both consume the same backend APIs:
  - Shared data models for decisions, options, media, comments, and annotations.
  - Client Portal uses a token-based access path with read/write scoped permissions; Limited comment actions, no admin controls.
  - Internal view uses full permissions (create/edit/delete, export, revoke).

- Branding & Theming:
  - Centralized design tokens for colors, font sizes, spacing, radii.
  - Components should adapt to the brand’s palette and be override-ready for client-specific branding.

- Error Handling:
  - Consistent error payload structure; user-friendly messages; telemetry hooks for errors.

---

## User Experience Flow

1) Client Portal (No-login Link)
- Client opens a shareable link to a decision with side-by-side options.
- Client views media and option details; annotations are visible and can be added by authorized clients if permitted.
- Client adds a comment, optionally mentioning internal team members. Comment appears in real-time or near real-time.
- Client annotates media coordinates to indicate preferences or concerns (where allowed).
- Client can approve or request changes, optionally leaving a short note; action triggers a notification to internal stakeholders.
- If OTP/verification is enabled:
  - Client enters email (if captured) or phone to receive an OTP.
  - Client enters OTP to validate before submitting approval or comments beyond a basic level.
- Notifications: when a new comment or mention appears, the client gets a notification via the chosen channel.

2) Internal Decision Detail (Admin)
- Internal user logs in to /internal/decisions/{decisionId}.
- See the decision overview with status, timestamps, and approval history.
- Open each option to view side-by-side comparisons, related media, and inline annotations.
- View and reply to comments; edit or delete comments within allowed windows; resolve comments if applicable.
- Add annotations to media; modify existing annotations or create new ones; link annotations to specific options if needed.
- Admin actions:
  - Edit decision details, revise option data, or adjust approvals.
  - Revoke approvals with rationale; log revoke reason in ApprovalHistory.
  - Export decision logs to PDF/JSON/CSV; download or share export URL.
- Real-time updates ensure parallel editors see changes instantly.

3) Notifications & Mentions
- Mentions trigger in-app notifications; mention recipients are auto-tagged and alerted.
- Clients and internal users receive notifications about:
  - New comments, replies, or annotations.
  - Status changes (approved, changes requested, revoked).
  - Mentions and upcoming deadlines/reminders.

4) Moderation
- Moderators can edit/delete inappropriate content within allowed windows.
- Moderation logs captured with user and timestamp.

**Never leave users wondering:**
- Skeleton screens matching content layout
- Progress bars for known durations
- Animated placeholders
- Spinners only for short waits (<3s)
- Stagger loading for multiple elements
- Shimmer effects on skeletons

### Empty States
**Make empty states helpful:**
- Illustrations or icons
- Helpful copy explaining why it's empty
- Clear CTA to add first item
- Examples or suggestions
- No "no data" text alone

---

## Unique Elements to Stand Out

### Distinctive Features
**Add personality:**
- Custom cursor effects on landing pages
- Animated page numbers or section indicators
- Unusual hover effects (magnification, distortion)
- Custom scrollbars
- Glassmorphism for overlays

- Border radius values
- Animation timing (200ms, 300ms, 500ms)
- Color system (primary, secondary, accent, neutrals)
- Typography scale
- Icon style (outline vs filled)
- Button styles across the app
- Form element styles

### What Can Vary
**Project-specific customization:**
- Color palette (different colors, same system)
- Layout creativity (grids, asymmetry)
- Illustration style
- Animation personality
- Feature-specific interactions

# Project-Specific Customizations

**IMPORTANT: This section contains the specific design requirements for THIS project. The guidelines above are universal best practices - these customizations below take precedence for project-specific decisions.**

## User Design Requirements

Client Portal and Internal Decision Detail.
  - Card-based, grid layouts, accessible components, responsive behavior (mobile-first).
  - Inline media annotation tools with zoom/pan, scrubber for media timeline (if applicable).
  - Rich text input with mention suggestions, emoji support optional.

---

## Implementation Requirements

### Frontend
- Build a cohesive design system-aligned UI:
  - Reusable React/Vue/Svelte components (Card, Button, Input, Tag, Tabs, MediaViewer, AnnotationOverlay, CommentThread).
  - MediaAnnotationOverlay component capable of rendering shapes, showing metadata, and allowing edits by authorized users.
  - CommentThread component with nested replies, edit/delete windows, mention highlighting, and inline actions (edit, delete, resolve).
  - Side-by-side OptionComparison component: responsive grid that adapts to viewport; shows media, specs, cost, and decision notes per option.
  - Real-time update indicators (typing, new comments, annotation changes).

- Pages:
  - Client Portal (No-login Link):
    - Route: /client-portal/:decisionToken
    - Features: authentication via token, side-by-side comparison, comment composer with mentions, annotation-capable media, approve/change-request actions, optional OTP flow.
  - Decision Detail (Internal):
    - Route: /internal/decisions/:decisionId
    - Features: full decision data, option-by-option annotations, audit trail, export controls, moderation tools, admin actions.

- Accessibility:
  - ARIA roles, keyboard navigable, proper focus management, readable contrast (WCAG 2.1 AA).

- Internationalization:
  - Prepare for i18n (text keys, date/number localization) if needed.

- Performance:
  - Lazy loading of options/media, pagination for comments, efficient annotation rendering for large media.
  - Debounced input for comment typing, optimistic UI updates.

- Mobile-first considerations:
  - Stacked layout with collapsible sections, touch-friendly controls, and large tap targets.

- Testing:
  - Unit tests for models and services, integration tests for end-to-end comment flow, WebSocket events, and export generation.

### Backend
- Data Models (SQL/NoSQL as appropriate):
  - User: id, name, email, role, preferences.
  - Project: id, name, branding tokens, default settings.
  - Decision: id, project_id, title, status (pending/approved/revoked/needs_changes), created_at, updated_at, approved_by, approved_at, revoked_at.
  - Option: id, decision_id, title, description, media_ids, specs, price, comparison_rank.
  - Media: id, asset_url, type (image/pdf/3d), media_metadata, linked_annotations (array of annotation_ids).
  - Annotation: id, media_id, option_id (nullable), shape_type (point/rect/polygon), coordinates (JSON), created_by, created_at, updated_by, updated_at, note.
  - Comment: id, decision_id, option_id (nullable), parent_id (nullable for threading), author_id, text, mentions (array of user_ids), created_at, updated_at, edited_by, edited_at, status (active/edited/deleted).
  - Notification: id, user_id, type (mention/comment/approval), reference_id, read_at, created_at.
  - ApprovalHistory: id, decision_id, user_id, action (created/approved/rejected/edited), timestamp, details (JSON).
  - Export: id, decision_id, type (pdf/json/csv), generated_at, url.

- APIs (REST or GraphQL):
  - Decisions
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}
    - POST /api/decisions
    - PUT /api/decisions/{id}
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/approve
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/revoke
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}/export
  - Options
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}/options
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/options
  - Media-Annotations
    - POST /api/media/{media_id}/annotations
    - PUT /api/annotations/{id}
    - DELETE /api/annotations/{id}
    - GET /api/media/{media_id}/annotations
  - Comments
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}/comments
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/comments
    - PUT /api/comments/{id}
    - DELETE /api/comments/{id}
  - Mentions & Notifications
    - POST /api/notifications/mention
    - GET /api/notifications?user_id=...
  - Real-time
    - WebSocket channel endpoints for /ws/decisions/{decisionId}
  - Exports
    - GET /api/exports/{export_id}
  - Auth
    - OAuth2 / JWT-based authentication; token validation; role checks.

- Database indexing and constraints:
  - Index on decision_id for comments, annotations; index on media_id; composite indexes for option and decision lookups.
  - Foreign keys: decision -> project; option -> decision; annotation -> media/option; comment -> decision/option/parent; notification -> user.

- Real-time & Messaging:
  - WebSocket channels per decision for comments and annotation updates.
  - Fallback to long-polling if WebSockets unavailable.
  - Debounce rapid comment streams; ensure at-least-once delivery semantics.

- Security:
  - No-login access tokens for client portal with expiration; token rotation.
  - Server-side validation for all inputs; server-side enforcement of business rules (e.g., cannot approve after revoke).
  - Rate limiting on comment POSTs and OTP validation; detect and mitigate abuse.

- Data Integrity & Auditing:
  - Immutable audit entries for approvals and edits; versioning for comments and annotations (with delta diffs if feasible).
  - Export exports reproduce exact state snapshots with timestamps.

### Integration
- Client Portal and Internal Decision Detail both consume the same backend APIs:
  - Shared data models for decisions, options, media, comments, and annotations.
  - Client Portal uses a token-based access path with read/write scoped permissions; Limited comment actions, no admin controls.
  - Internal view uses full permissions (create/edit/delete, export, revoke).

- Branding & Theming:
  - Centralized design tokens for colors, font sizes, spacing, radii.
  - Components should adapt to the brand’s palette and be override-ready for client-specific branding.

- Error Handling:
  - Consistent error payload structure; user-friendly messages; telemetry hooks for errors.

---

## User Experience Flow

1) Client Portal (No-login Link)
- Client opens a shareable link to a decision with side-by-side options.
- Client views media and option details; annotations are visible and can be added by authorized clients if permitted.
- Client adds a comment, optionally mentioning internal team members. Comment appears in real-time or near real-time.
- Client annotates media coordinates to indicate preferences or concerns (where allowed).
- Client can approve or request changes, optionally leaving a short note; action triggers a notification to internal stakeholders.
- If OTP/verification is enabled:
  - Client enters email (if captured) or phone to receive an OTP.
  - Client enters OTP to validate before submitting approval or comments beyond a basic level.
- Notifications: when a new comment or mention appears, the client gets a notification via the chosen channel.

2) Internal Decision Detail (Admin)
- Internal user logs in to /internal/decisions/{decisionId}.
- See the decision overview with status, timestamps, and approval history.
- Open each option to view side-by-side comparisons, related media, and inline annotations.
- View and reply to comments; edit or delete comments within allowed windows; resolve comments if applicable.
- Add annotations to media; modify existing annotations or create new ones; link annotations to specific options if needed.
- Admin actions:
  - Edit decision details, revise option data, or adjust approvals.
  - Revoke approvals with rationale; log revoke reason in ApprovalHistory.
  - Export decision logs to PDF/JSON/CSV; download or share export URL.
- Real-time updates ensure parallel editors see changes instantly.

3) Notifications & Mentions
- Mentions trigger in-app notifications; mention recipients are auto-tagged and alerted.
- Clients and internal users receive notifications about:
  - New comments, replies, or annotations.
  - Status changes (approved, changes requested, revoked).
  - Mentions and upcoming deadlines/reminders.

4) Moderation
- Moderators can edit/delete inappropriate content within allowed windows.
- Moderation logs captured with user and timestamp.

 for bestpractices and # Light Tasking & Webhook Triggers

## Overview
Build a lightweight tasking and webhook automation layer that ties simple follow-up tasks to approval outcomes within Archject. This system fires webhooks (and Zapier-compatible actions) to integrate with existing PM/accounting tools, while providing audit trails, security through payload signing, and developer management keys. The feature spans multiple pages: Settings / Preferences, Create/Edit Decision Page, and Project Workspace Page. The solution should be modular, API-first, and visually consistent with the Archject design system.

## Components to Build
- Light Tasking Engine
  - Data model for Task: id, decisionId, assignee (userId), dueDate, status, priority, notes, createdAt, updatedAt

# Light Tasking & Webhook Triggers

## Overview
Build a lightweight tasking and webhook automation layer that ties simple follow-up tasks to approval outcomes within Archject. This system fires webhooks (and Zapier-compatible actions) to integrate with existing PM/accounting tools, while providing audit trails, security through payload signing, and developer management keys. The feature spans multiple pages: Settings / Preferences, Create/Edit Decision Page, and Project Workspace Page. The solution should be modular, API-first, and visually consistent with the Archject design system.

## Components to Build
- Light Tasking Engine
  - Data model for Task: id, decisionId, assignee (userId), dueDate, status, priority, notes, createdAt, updatedAt
  - Trigger rules: on decision status transitions (e.g., awaiting_approval -> approved/rejected), on explicit approvals, or on schedule-based reminders
  - Retry/backoff logic for webhooks
  - Audit logging of task creation, updates, and webhook events
- Webhook System
  - Webhook endpoints with per-endpoint signing (HMAC-SHA256 or equivalent)
  - Retries with exponential backoff, jitter, and max attempts
  - Payload templates for common actions; Zapier-compatible payloads
  - Public API keys / developer keys management
  - Endpoint management: create, update, delete endpoints; status monitoring
- Zapier / Integrations Bridge
  - Native support or published webhook schemas for Zapier Zaps
  - Connection templates and test payloads
- Decision Object Linkage
  - Link Task to Decision (one-to-many if multiple tasks per decision)
  - Reminders tied to decision milestones
- Settings / Preferences Pages
  - Billing: plan, billing history, invoice export
  - Branding: logo, colors, letterhead, branding presets per workspace
  - Notification Preferences: email, in-app, webhooks, and global vs. per-decision overrides
  - Integrations: connected webhook endpoints, Zapier, other tools
  - API Keys: generate, revoke, rotate, scopes
  - Workspace Data Export: data export jobs (Decision Logs, tasks, webhooks), export formats (JSON, CSV, JSONL)
- Create / Edit Decision Page
  - Multi-step editor for Decision Object
  - Metadata: title, projectId, client, due date, status, tags
  - Options Upload: images, specs, layouts (drag-and-drop, batch upload)
  - Side-by-Side Comparison Setup: ability to align optionA vs optionB with visual diff
  - Approval Rules: who can approve, required number of approvals, conditional rules
  - Assignee: assign decision responsibility
  - Schedule Reminders: reminder cadence, recipients, channels
- Project Workspace Page
  - Project-level workspace listing Decisions, Project Files, Team Members, Templates, and Project Overview
  - Branding and Settings quick access
  - Quick actions to create Decision, trigger reminder tasks, connect webhooks

  - Access control per workspace with role-based permissions (Viewer, Editor, Admin)

## User Experience Flow

1) User logs into Archject and navigates to Settings / Preferences
2) User configures API Keys, connects a Zapier-compatible webhook, and sets notification preferences
3) User creates a new Decision via the Create Decision Page
   - Uploads option assets (images/specs/layouts)
   - Sets up side-by-side comparison
   - Defines approval rules and assigns an approver
   - Sets reminder schedule
   - Publishes decision
4) System creates initial light tasks associated with the decision; triggers webhooks to connected tools
5) When an approval outcome occurs (approve/reject), a new task is created or updated, and webhook payloads are dispatched
6) All actions are logged in Audit Logs; user can export Decision Logs from Settings
7) Project Workspace Page displays all decisions, templates, team members, and branding; tasks and webhooks are visible and filterable
