# Project-Specific Customizations

**IMPORTANT: This section contains the specific design requirements for THIS project. The guidelines above are universal best practices - these customizations below take precedence for project-specific decisions.**

## User Design Requirements

Client Portal and Internal Decision Detail.
  - Card-based, grid layouts, accessible components, responsive behavior (mobile-first).
  - Inline media annotation tools with zoom/pan, scrubber for media timeline (if applicable).
  - Rich text input with mention suggestions, emoji support optional.

---

## Implementation Requirements

### Frontend
- Build a cohesive design system-aligned UI:
  - Reusable React/Vue/Svelte components (Card, Button, Input, Tag, Tabs, MediaViewer, AnnotationOverlay, CommentThread).
  - MediaAnnotationOverlay component capable of rendering shapes, showing metadata, and allowing edits by authorized users.
  - CommentThread component with nested replies, edit/delete windows, mention highlighting, and inline actions (edit, delete, resolve).
  - Side-by-side OptionComparison component: responsive grid that adapts to viewport; shows media, specs, cost, and decision notes per option.
  - Real-time update indicators (typing, new comments, annotation changes).

- Pages:
  - Client Portal (No-login Link):
    - Route: /client-portal/:decisionToken
    - Features: authentication via token, side-by-side comparison, comment composer with mentions, annotation-capable media, approve/change-request actions, optional OTP flow.
  - Decision Detail (Internal):
    - Route: /internal/decisions/:decisionId
    - Features: full decision data, option-by-option annotations, audit trail, export controls, moderation tools, admin actions.

- Accessibility:
  - ARIA roles, keyboard navigable, proper focus management, readable contrast (WCAG 2.1 AA).

- Internationalization:
  - Prepare for i18n (text keys, date/number localization) if needed.

- Performance:
  - Lazy loading of options/media, pagination for comments, efficient annotation rendering for large media.
  - Debounced input for comment typing, optimistic UI updates.

- Mobile-first considerations:
  - Stacked layout with collapsible sections, touch-friendly controls, and large tap targets.

- Testing:
  - Unit tests for models and services, integration tests for end-to-end comment flow, WebSocket events, and export generation.

### Backend
- Data Models (SQL/NoSQL as appropriate):
  - User: id, name, email, role, preferences.
  - Project: id, name, branding tokens, default settings.
  - Decision: id, project_id, title, status (pending/approved/revoked/needs_changes), created_at, updated_at, approved_by, approved_at, revoked_at.
  - Option: id, decision_id, title, description, media_ids, specs, price, comparison_rank.
  - Media: id, asset_url, type (image/pdf/3d), media_metadata, linked_annotations (array of annotation_ids).
  - Annotation: id, media_id, option_id (nullable), shape_type (point/rect/polygon), coordinates (JSON), created_by, created_at, updated_by, updated_at, note.
  - Comment: id, decision_id, option_id (nullable), parent_id (nullable for threading), author_id, text, mentions (array of user_ids), created_at, updated_at, edited_by, edited_at, status (active/edited/deleted).
  - Notification: id, user_id, type (mention/comment/approval), reference_id, read_at, created_at.
  - ApprovalHistory: id, decision_id, user_id, action (created/approved/rejected/edited), timestamp, details (JSON).
  - Export: id, decision_id, type (pdf/json/csv), generated_at, url.

- APIs (REST or GraphQL):
  - Decisions
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}
    - POST /api/decisions
    - PUT /api/decisions/{id}
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/approve
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/revoke
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}/export
  - Options
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}/options
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/options
  - Media-Annotations
    - POST /api/media/{media_id}/annotations
    - PUT /api/annotations/{id}
    - DELETE /api/annotations/{id}
    - GET /api/media/{media_id}/annotations
  - Comments
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}/comments
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/comments
    - PUT /api/comments/{id}
    - DELETE /api/comments/{id}
  - Mentions & Notifications
    - POST /api/notifications/mention
    - GET /api/notifications?user_id=...
  - Real-time
    - WebSocket channel endpoints for /ws/decisions/{decisionId}
  - Exports
    - GET /api/exports/{export_id}
  - Auth
    - OAuth2 / JWT-based authentication; token validation; role checks.

- Database indexing and constraints:
  - Index on decision_id for comments, annotations; index on media_id; composite indexes for option and decision lookups.
  - Foreign keys: decision -> project; option -> decision; annotation -> media/option; comment -> decision/option/parent; notification -> user.

- Real-time & Messaging:
  - WebSocket channels per decision for comments and annotation updates.
  - Fallback to long-polling if WebSockets unavailable.
  - Debounce rapid comment streams; ensure at-least-once delivery semantics.

- Security:
  - No-login access tokens for client portal with expiration; token rotation.
  - Server-side validation for all inputs; server-side enforcement of business rules (e.g., cannot approve after revoke).
  - Rate limiting on comment POSTs and OTP validation; detect and mitigate abuse.

- Data Integrity & Auditing:
  - Immutable audit entries for approvals and edits; versioning for comments and annotations (with delta diffs if feasible).
  - Export exports reproduce exact state snapshots with timestamps.

### Integration
- Client Portal and Internal Decision Detail both consume the same backend APIs:
  - Shared data models for decisions, options, media, comments, and annotations.
  - Client Portal uses a token-based access path with read/write scoped permissions; Limited comment actions, no admin controls.
  - Internal view uses full permissions (create/edit/delete, export, revoke).

- Branding & Theming:
  - Centralized design tokens for colors, font sizes, spacing, radii.
  - Components should adapt to the brand’s palette and be override-ready for client-specific branding.

- Error Handling:
  - Consistent error payload structure; user-friendly messages; telemetry hooks for errors.

---

## User Experience Flow

1) Client Portal (No-login Link)
- Client opens a shareable link to a decision with side-by-side options.
- Client views media and option details; annotations are visible and can be added by authorized clients if permitted.
- Client adds a comment, optionally mentioning internal team members. Comment appears in real-time or near real-time.
- Client annotates media coordinates to indicate preferences or concerns (where allowed).
- Client can approve or request changes, optionally leaving a short note; action triggers a notification to internal stakeholders.
- If OTP/verification is enabled:
  - Client enters email (if captured) or phone to receive an OTP.
  - Client enters OTP to validate before submitting approval or comments beyond a basic level.
- Notifications: when a new comment or mention appears, the client gets a notification via the chosen channel.

2) Internal Decision Detail (Admin)
- Internal user logs in to /internal/decisions/{decisionId}.
- See the decision overview with status, timestamps, and approval history.
- Open each option to view side-by-side comparisons, related media, and inline annotations.
- View and reply to comments; edit or delete comments within allowed windows; resolve comments if applicable.
- Add annotations to media; modify existing annotations or create new ones; link annotations to specific options if needed.
- Admin actions:
  - Edit decision details, revise option data, or adjust approvals.
  - Revoke approvals with rationale; log revoke reason in ApprovalHistory.
  - Export decision logs to PDF/JSON/CSV; download or share export URL.
- Real-time updates ensure parallel editors see changes instantly.

3) Notifications & Mentions
- Mentions trigger in-app notifications; mention recipients are auto-tagged and alerted.
- Clients and internal users receive notifications about:
  - New comments, replies, or annotations.
  - Status changes (approved, changes requested, revoked).
  - Mentions and upcoming deadlines/reminders.

4) Moderation
- Moderators can edit/delete inappropriate content within allowed windows.
- Moderation logs captured with user and timestamp.

# Project-Specific Customizations

**IMPORTANT: This section contains the specific design requirements for THIS project. The guidelines above are universal best practices - these customizations below take precedence for project-specific decisions.**

## User Design Requirements

Client Portal and Internal Decision Detail.
  - Card-based, grid layouts, accessible components, responsive behavior (mobile-first).
  - Inline media annotation tools with zoom/pan, scrubber for media timeline (if applicable).
  - Rich text input with mention suggestions, emoji support optional.

---

## Implementation Requirements

### Frontend
- Build a cohesive design system-aligned UI:
  - Reusable React/Vue/Svelte components (Card, Button, Input, Tag, Tabs, MediaViewer, AnnotationOverlay, CommentThread).
  - MediaAnnotationOverlay component capable of rendering shapes, showing metadata, and allowing edits by authorized users.
  - CommentThread component with nested replies, edit/delete windows, mention highlighting, and inline actions (edit, delete, resolve).
  - Side-by-side OptionComparison component: responsive grid that adapts to viewport; shows media, specs, cost, and decision notes per option.
  - Real-time update indicators (typing, new comments, annotation changes).

- Pages:
  - Client Portal (No-login Link):
    - Route: /client-portal/:decisionToken
    - Features: authentication via token, side-by-side comparison, comment composer with mentions, annotation-capable media, approve/change-request actions, optional OTP flow.
  - Decision Detail (Internal):
    - Route: /internal/decisions/:decisionId
    - Features: full decision data, option-by-option annotations, audit trail, export controls, moderation tools, admin actions.

- Accessibility:
  - ARIA roles, keyboard navigable, proper focus management, readable contrast (WCAG 2.1 AA).

- Internationalization:
  - Prepare for i18n (text keys, date/number localization) if needed.

- Performance:
  - Lazy loading of options/media, pagination for comments, efficient annotation rendering for large media.
  - Debounced input for comment typing, optimistic UI updates.

- Mobile-first considerations:
  - Stacked layout with collapsible sections, touch-friendly controls, and large tap targets.

- Testing:
  - Unit tests for models and services, integration tests for end-to-end comment flow, WebSocket events, and export generation.

### Backend
- Data Models (SQL/NoSQL as appropriate):
  - User: id, name, email, role, preferences.
  - Project: id, name, branding tokens, default settings.
  - Decision: id, project_id, title, status (pending/approved/revoked/needs_changes), created_at, updated_at, approved_by, approved_at, revoked_at.
  - Option: id, decision_id, title, description, media_ids, specs, price, comparison_rank.
  - Media: id, asset_url, type (image/pdf/3d), media_metadata, linked_annotations (array of annotation_ids).
  - Annotation: id, media_id, option_id (nullable), shape_type (point/rect/polygon), coordinates (JSON), created_by, created_at, updated_by, updated_at, note.
  - Comment: id, decision_id, option_id (nullable), parent_id (nullable for threading), author_id, text, mentions (array of user_ids), created_at, updated_at, edited_by, edited_at, status (active/edited/deleted).
  - Notification: id, user_id, type (mention/comment/approval), reference_id, read_at, created_at.
  - ApprovalHistory: id, decision_id, user_id, action (created/approved/rejected/edited), timestamp, details (JSON).
  - Export: id, decision_id, type (pdf/json/csv), generated_at, url.

- APIs (REST or GraphQL):
  - Decisions
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}
    - POST /api/decisions
    - PUT /api/decisions/{id}
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/approve
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/revoke
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}/export
  - Options
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}/options
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/options
  - Media-Annotations
    - POST /api/media/{media_id}/annotations
    - PUT /api/annotations/{id}
    - DELETE /api/annotations/{id}
    - GET /api/media/{media_id}/annotations
  - Comments
    - GET /api/decisions/{id}/comments
    - POST /api/decisions/{id}/comments
    - PUT /api/comments/{id}
    - DELETE /api/comments/{id}
  - Mentions & Notifications
    - POST /api/notifications/mention
    - GET /api/notifications?user_id=...
  - Real-time
    - WebSocket channel endpoints for /ws/decisions/{decisionId}
  - Exports
    - GET /api/exports/{export_id}
  - Auth
    - OAuth2 / JWT-based authentication; token validation; role checks.

- Database indexing and constraints:
  - Index on decision_id for comments, annotations; index on media_id; composite indexes for option and decision lookups.
  - Foreign keys: decision -> project; option -> decision; annotation -> media/option; comment -> decision/option/parent; notification -> user.

- Real-time & Messaging:
  - WebSocket channels per decision for comments and annotation updates.
  - Fallback to long-polling if WebSockets unavailable.
  - Debounce rapid comment streams; ensure at-least-once delivery semantics.

- Security:
  - No-login access tokens for client portal with expiration; token rotation.
  - Server-side validation for all inputs; server-side enforcement of business rules (e.g., cannot approve after revoke).
  - Rate limiting on comment POSTs and OTP validation; detect and mitigate abuse.

- Data Integrity & Auditing:
  - Immutable audit entries for approvals and edits; versioning for comments and annotations (with delta diffs if feasible).
  - Export exports reproduce exact state snapshots with timestamps.

### Integration
- Client Portal and Internal Decision Detail both consume the same backend APIs:
  - Shared data models for decisions, options, media, comments, and annotations.
  - Client Portal uses a token-based access path with read/write scoped permissions; Limited comment actions, no admin controls.
  - Internal view uses full permissions (create/edit/delete, export, revoke).

- Branding & Theming:
  - Centralized design tokens for colors, font sizes, spacing, radii.
  - Components should adapt to the brand’s palette and be override-ready for client-specific branding.

- Error Handling:
  - Consistent error payload structure; user-friendly messages; telemetry hooks for errors.

---

## User Experience Flow

1) Client Portal (No-login Link)
- Client opens a shareable link to a decision with side-by-side options.
- Client views media and option details; annotations are visible and can be added by authorized clients if permitted.
- Client adds a comment, optionally mentioning internal team members. Comment appears in real-time or near real-time.
- Client annotates media coordinates to indicate preferences or concerns (where allowed).
- Client can approve or request changes, optionally leaving a short note; action triggers a notification to internal stakeholders.
- If OTP/verification is enabled:
  - Client enters email (if captured) or phone to receive an OTP.
  - Client enters OTP to validate before submitting approval or comments beyond a basic level.
- Notifications: when a new comment or mention appears, the client gets a notification via the chosen channel.

2) Internal Decision Detail (Admin)
- Internal user logs in to /internal/decisions/{decisionId}.
- See the decision overview with status, timestamps, and approval history.
- Open each option to view side-by-side comparisons, related media, and inline annotations.
- View and reply to comments; edit or delete comments within allowed windows; resolve comments if applicable.
- Add annotations to media; modify existing annotations or create new ones; link annotations to specific options if needed.
- Admin actions:
  - Edit decision details, revise option data, or adjust approvals.
  - Revoke approvals with rationale; log revoke reason in ApprovalHistory.
  - Export decision logs to PDF/JSON/CSV; download or share export URL.
- Real-time updates ensure parallel editors see changes instantly.

3) Notifications & Mentions
- Mentions trigger in-app notifications; mention recipients are auto-tagged and alerted.
- Clients and internal users receive notifications about:
  - New comments, replies, or annotations.
  - Status changes (approved, changes requested, revoked).
  - Mentions and upcoming deadlines/reminders.

4) Moderation
- Moderators can edit/delete inappropriate content within allowed windows.
- Moderation logs captured with user and timestamp.

 for bestpractices and # Search & Filter Functionality

## Overview
Implement a scalable, fast, and secure Search & Filter system that powers full-text search and faceted filtering across Projects, Decisions, Files, and Comments. The system should support autocomplete suggestions, saved searches, access-control aware results, and seamless integration with the existing Archject dashboards and workspaces. This feature underpins the Dashboard, Decisions List / Content Browser, and Project Workspace pages, delivering a consistent search experience with real-time results, robust filtering, and efficient bulk actions.

## Components to Build
- 1) Search Indexer
  - Index strategy for Projects, Decisions, Files, and Comments metadata and content.
  - Support incremental indexing on create/update/delete events.
  - Define analyzers, tokenizers, and filters appropriate for multilingual content.
- 2) Search API Layer
  - REST/GraphQL endpoints for index operations, queries, autocompletion, and saved searches.
  - Enforce access control at query time (per-user/project permissions).
- 3) Autocomplete & Suggestions Engine
  - Real-time query suggestions as users type, including cross-entity suggestions (projects, decisions, files, comments).
  - Synonym handling and typo tolerance.
- 4) Faceted Filters & Results View
  - UI components for facets (project, status, type, date ranges, tags, assignee, client status, file type, etc.).
  - Support for multi-select facets, “at least one” vs “all” modes, and collapsed/expanded panels.
- 5) Saved Searches & Quick Actions
  - UI and backend support for saving, naming, sharing, and reusing searches.
  - Quick actions from search results (open detail, preview, bulk share/export).
- 6) Bulk Actions & Integration
  - Bulk share links, export results (CSV/JSON/PDF), and bulk status changes.
  - Ensure actions respect row-level permissions and ownership.
- 7) UI Integration Components
  - Dashboard widgets: active projects, decisions awaiting client response, recent activity, new decision creation, share client links.
  - Decisions List / Content Browser grid/table with inline preview and bulk action controls.
  - Project Workspace: search-enabled lists for decisions, files, team members, templates, and a project overview panel.
- 8) Security & Audit
  - Access control filters in every search response.
  - Audit logging for search queries, saved searches, and bulk actions.

# Search & Filter Functionality

## Overview
Implement a scalable, fast, and secure Search & Filter system that powers full-text search and faceted filtering across Projects, Decisions, Files, and Comments. The system should support autocomplete suggestions, saved searches, access-control aware results, and seamless integration with the existing Archject dashboards and workspaces. This feature underpins the Dashboard, Decisions List / Content Browser, and Project Workspace pages, delivering a consistent search experience with real-time results, robust filtering, and efficient bulk actions.

## Components to Build
- 1) Search Indexer
  - Index strategy for Projects, Decisions, Files, and Comments metadata and content.
  - Support incremental indexing on create/update/delete events.
  - Define analyzers, tokenizers, and filters appropriate for multilingual content.
- 2) Search API Layer
  - REST/GraphQL endpoints for index operations, queries, autocompletion, and saved searches.
  - Enforce access control at query time (per-user/project permissions).
- 3) Autocomplete & Suggestions Engine
  - Real-time query suggestions as users type, including cross-entity suggestions (projects, decisions, files, comments).
  - Synonym handling and typo tolerance.
- 4) Faceted Filters & Results View
  - UI components for facets (project, status, type, date ranges, tags, assignee, client status, file type, etc.).
  - Support for multi-select facets, “at least one” vs “all” modes, and collapsed/expanded panels.
- 5) Saved Searches & Quick Actions
  - UI and backend support for saving, naming, sharing, and reusing searches.
  - Quick actions from search results (open detail, preview, bulk share/export).
- 6) Bulk Actions & Integration
  - Bulk share links, export results (CSV/JSON/PDF), and bulk status changes.
  - Ensure actions respect row-level permissions and ownership.
- 7) UI Integration Components
  - Dashboard widgets: active projects, decisions awaiting client response, recent activity, new decision creation, share client links.
  - Decisions List / Content Browser grid/table with inline preview and bulk action controls.
  - Project Workspace: search-enabled lists for decisions, files, team members, templates, and a project overview panel.
- 8) Security & Audit
  - Access control filters in every search response.
  - Audit logging for search queries, saved searches, and bulk actions.

## Implementation Requirements

### Frontend
- Search Bar
  - Global search field with real-time autocomplete dropdown.
  - Debounced input (250ms) with fuzzy matching suggestions.
  - Keyboard navigation (arrow keys, Enter to select).
- Faceted Filter Panel
  - Left-hand or top panel with collapsible sections for: Projects, Decisions, Files, Comments, Time Range, Tags/Labels, Status, Assignees, Client Status, and Custom Attributes.
  - Multi-select, counts next to facet options, “Clear all” and “Apply” actions.
  - Persist facet state in URL query string for shareable links and deep-linking.
- Results Grid / List
  - Consistent card/table layout across Projects, Decisions, Files, and Comments.
  - Highlight matched terms in results.
  - Quick preview drawer or side panel with essential details and actions (open, share, export).
- Autocomplete & Saved Searches
  - Autocomplete chips for saved searches, with ability to load, rename, or delete.
  - “Save this search” button with optional description and sharing toggle.
- Bulk Actions Bar
  - Row selection with a sticky bulk actions bar for share, export, and status changes.
  - Confirmation modals for destructive actions.
- Accessibility

- Design system alignment
  - Cards, panels, and typography follow the project’s visual style (see Design Guidelines below).
- Performance
  - Infinite or paginated results with cursor-based pagination where applicable.
  - Debounced or lazy-loading of results; avoid re-requesting on minor facet changes.

### Backend
- Data Modeling
  - Unified search index documents for Projects, Decisions, Files, Comments with fields:
    - id, type, projectId, title, excerpt, content, authorId, createdAt, updatedAt
    - status, tags, assignees, clientStatus, fileType, fileSize, path/URL, version
    - decision-specific fields: decisionOptionIds, choices, approvedAt, reviewerIds
  - Mappings for nested fields and lightweight denormalization where necessary for speed.
- Search Engine
  - Use Elasticsearch or Algolia (as per project standard). Provide a pluggable abstraction to switch backends if needed.
  - Define index pipelines:
    - Analyzers for multilingual text, stemming, stop words, edge n-grams for autocomplete.
  - Indexing jobs:
    - On create/update/delete for Projects, Decisions, Files, Comments.
    - Incremental updates with per-field delta handling.
- APIs
  - Endpoint: POST /api/search/index (index a document)
  - Endpoint: POST /api/search/remove (remove a document by id)
  - Endpoint: POST /api/search/query (full-text + facets, with pagination)
  - Endpoint: GET /api/search/autocomplete (suggestions for current input)
  - Endpoint: GET /api/search/saved-searches (list)
  - Endpoint: POST /api/search/saved-searches (create)
  - Endpoint: PUT /api/search/saved-searches/{id} (update)
  - Endpoint: DELETE /api/search/saved-searches/{id} (delete)
  - Endpoint: POST /api/search/export (export current results as CSV/JSON/PDF)
- Access Control
  - Enforce per-user permissions at query time.
  - Exclude results user cannot access; return empty results with appropriate metadata if needed.
- Caching & Performance
  - Result-level caching for popular queries.
  - Invalidate cache on index updates.
- Validation
  - Validate input payloads with strict schemas.
  - Rate limiting on heavy search operations if needed.

### Integration
- Event-Driven Updates
  - Trigger re-indexing on CRUD operations for related entities.
- UI State Synchronization
  - Sync URL query string with frontend filters; preserve state on navigation.
- Data Flow
  - Frontend sends search query and facet selections to backend.
  - Backend returns results with highlights, total counts, and suggestions.
  - Frontend renders results and updates facets with counts from the same search context when applicable.

## User Experience Flow
- User opens Dashboard
  - Sees a search bar at top and a quick facet-enabled card overview (active projects, decisions awaiting client response, recent activity).
  - Clicking a quick action creates a new Decision or generates a client share link, prefilled with project context.
- User performs a global search
  - Starts typing; autocomplete presents project, decision, file, and comment suggestions.
  - User selects a suggestion; results panel updates to show matches with highlights.
- User refines search with facets
  - Applies multiple facets (e.g., Status: Approved, Tag: Client-Review, Date range).
  - Results refresh with updated counts; URL updates to reflect current filters.
- User saves a search
  - Saves current query and facets as a named search; can opt to share with team or client access.
  - Saved search appears in the Saved Searches panel for quick reuse.
- User executes bulk actions
  - In Decisions List, select multiple decisions.
  - Bulk actions: Share links, Export (CSV/JSON/PDF), Change Status (e.g., mark as Approved or In Progress).
  - Confirmation required for destructive actions; audit log created.
- Accessibility and mobile
  - Consistent layout across devices; responsive panels collapse gracefully.
  - Large tap targets and accessible controls; screen readers announce search results and facet counts.
