⚠️ CRITICAL EXECUTION RULES - READ FIRST ⚠️
❌ NEVER run: npm run dev, npm start, yarn dev, pnpm dev, or ANY development server
❌ NEVER run: long-running processes, servers, or commands that don't exit
❌ NEVER test the application by starting it
✅ ALLOWED: npm install, npm run build, npm run test (if needed)
✅ YOUR TASK: Create/modify files only, then STOP and EXIT immediately
⚠️ The MCP server handles all testing and validation separately

- Gradient mesh animations
- Morphing blob animations


### Layout Patterns
**Use modern grid systems:**
- Bento grids (asymmetric card layouts)
- Masonry layouts for varied content
- Feature sections with diagonal cuts or curves
- Overlapping elements with proper z-index
- Split-screen designs with scroll-triggered reveals

**Avoid:** Traditional 3-column equal grids

### Scroll Animations
**Engage users as they scroll:**
- Fade-in and slide-up animations for sections
- Scroll-triggered parallax effects
- Progress indicators for long pages
- Sticky elements that transform on scroll
- Horizontal scroll sections for portfolios
- Text reveal animations (word by word, letter by letter)
- Number counters animating into view

**Avoid:** Static pages with no scroll interaction

### Call-to-Action Areas
**Make CTAs impossible to miss:**
- Gradient buttons with hover effects
- Floating action buttons with micro-interactions
- Animated borders or glowing effects
- Scale/lift on hover
- Interactive elements that respond to mouse position
- Pulsing indicators for primary actions

---

## Dashboard Applications

### Layout Structure
**Always use collapsible side navigation:**
- Sidebar that can collapse to icons only
- Smooth transition animations between states
- Persistent navigation state (remember user preference)
- Mobile: drawer that slides in/out
- Desktop: sidebar with expand/collapse toggle
- Icons visible even when collapsed

**Structure:**
```
/dashboard (layout wrapper with sidebar)
  /dashboard/overview
  /dashboard/analytics
  /dashboard/settings
  /dashboard/users
  /dashboard/projects
```

All dashboard pages should be nested inside the dashboard layout, not separate routes.

### Data Tables
**Modern table design:**
- Sticky headers on scroll
- Row hover states with subtle elevation
- Sortable columns with clear indicators
- Pagination with items-per-page control
- Search/filter with instant feedback

 for bestpractices and # Session Management

## Overview
Build a secure, scalable session and token management system that issues short-lived access tokens and long-lived, rotatable refresh tokens, enforces single-use refresh tokens, supports token blacklisting/revocation, and provides device/session management with remote sign-out. Integrate with a user profile page, settings, and an admin dashboard. Ensure secure cookies, robust validation, auditability, and a smooth UX aligned with Archject’s design system.

## Components to Build
1) Session Management Service
- Token issuance (access tokens, refresh tokens)
- Refresh token rotation and single-use enforcement
- Token blacklist/revocation store (Redis)
- Token validation middleware
- Device and session tracking (IP, user agent, device fingerprint)
- Remote sign-out / revoke by admin or user
- Secure cookie handling (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)

2) Profile Page – Session & Devices
- List active sessions/devices per user
- View details (device, last used, IP, app, OS, browser)
- Revoke individual sessions or all except current
- Sign out from all devices with a single action
- Web and mobile-safe presentation

3) Settings / Preferences
- Account and workspace settings integration
- API keys management (generation, rotation, revocation)
- Billing-related toggles (enable/disable, plan status)
- Branding settings (logo, color tokens, theme)
- Notification preferences (email, push, webhooks)
- Data export (workspace export request and status)

4) Admin Dashboard
- Platform-wide accounts management
- Monitoring usage metrics, quotas, and requests
- System health indicators (uptime, error rates, Redis health)
- Token/revocation audit trails and security events
- Admins can suspend/unsuspend accounts, revoke tokens, and force sign-out

5) API Layer and Persistence
- REST/GraphQL endpoints for token lifecycle, sessions, admin actions
- Database tables for sessions, devices, tokens (with TTLs and audit fields)
- Redis-backed blacklist/revocation store
- Audit logging with immutable or append-only approach

6) Frontend Integration
- User profile page: sessions listing and actions
- Settings page: API keys, branding, notifications, export
- Admin dashboard: users, sessions, system health, logs
- Secure, responsive UI that follows the design system

7) Security & Compliance
- CSRF protection for cookie-based flows
- JWT signing with strong algorithms (RS256 or ES256)
- Refresh token rotation with one-time use enforcement
- Blacklist checks on access token validation
- IP/domain restrictions where applicable
- Security logging and alerting hooks

## Implementation Requirements

### Frontend
- Pages/Views
  - Profile: Sessions and devices management
  - Settings: Preferences, API keys, branding, billing, exports, notifications
  - Admin Dashboard: Accounts, usage, requests, system health, security events
- Components
  - Token/session cards with status, last used, and actions (revoke, sign out)
  - Device history table with search, sort, and filter
  - API Keys manager with generate/rotate/revoke
  - Branding panel (upload logo, color tokens, theme toggle)
  - Billing section with plan status and invoices overview
  - Data export request panel with status indicator
- Interactions
  - Revoke individual sessions or all sessions
  - Sign-out from other devices with confirmation dialogs
  - Token refresh session refresh flows (in-app re-auth if needed)
  - Real-time-ish feedback (toasts, optimistic UI for revocation)
- Security UX
  - Clear indication of sensitive actions
  - Confirmations for admin actions
  - Optional MFA prompts for critical operations if the platform supports it
- Data visualization
  - Simple dashboards: recent login activity, token activity counts

### Backend
- APIs/Endpoints (examples; adjust to framework):
  - POST /auth/login -> issue access/refresh tokens
  - POST /auth/refresh -> issue new access token; rotate refresh token; invalidate previous refresh token
  - POST /auth/logout -> revoke current refresh token; invalidate access tokens via blacklist
  - POST /auth/force-logout -> admin-initiated sign-out across sessions for a user
  - GET /sessions -> list user sessions (profile)
  - DELETE /sessions/{sessionId} -> revoke specific session
  - DELETE /sessions -> revoke all sessions except current
  - GET /admin/users -> list accounts; pagination, filtering
  - POST /admin/users/{id}/suspend -> suspend account
  - POST /admin/tokens/revoke -> blacklist a token or refresh token
  - GET /admin/system-health -> health metrics
  - POST /apikeys -> create API key
  - GET /apikeys -> list API keys
  - DELETE /apikeys/{id} -> revoke API key
  - POST /branding -> update branding assets/settings
  - POST /billing -> update billing options
  - POST /export -> request workspace data export; poll/export status
- Data Models (core)
  - User
    - id, email, password_hash, status, created_at, last_login
  - Session
    - id, user_id, device_id, ip_address, user_agent, created_at, last_used_at, is_revoked, expires_at
  - Device
    - id, user_id, device_name, fingerprint, os, browser, last_seen_at, location
  - RefreshToken
    - id, user_id, device_id, token_hash, expires_at, used_at, revoked
  - AccessToken
    - token_jti, user_id, device_id, expires_at (stored in JWT claims)
  - TokenAudit
    - id, user_id, action, target_session_id, timestamp, actor (user/admin), ip_address
  - APIKey
    - id, user_id, key_hash, name, scopes, created_at, last_used_at, revoked
  - Branding
    - id, user_id (workspace), logo_url, theme, primary_color, secondary_color
  - Billing
    - id, workspace_id, plan, status, next_due, amount_due
- Security
  - Password handling (already existing)
  - Token signing keys management (rotate keys; store public key for verification)
  - Redis connection for token blacklist with TTLs
  - CSRF protection on state-changing endpoints
  - Encrypted storage for sensitive fields (token hashes)
- Validation
  - Strict input validation on all endpoints
  - Validate IP address formats, user_agent parsing blocks
  - Ensure token claims contain expected fields; reject malformed tokens
  - Rate limiting on sensitive operations (bulk revoke, admin actions)

### Integration
- How components connect
  - Frontend calls backend auth/session APIs for login, refresh, logout
  - Profile/Settings pages fetch user sessions, API keys, branding, and export options
  - Admin Dashboard uses admin APIs to manage users, sessions, and system health
  - Redis-backed blacklist is consulted by an authentication middleware for access token validation
  - Token rotation flow updates both refresh token store and blacklist
  - Data export ties into workspace data services; export status streamed back to UI
- Authentication Flow
  - On login: issue short-lived access token (expires ~15 minutes) and refresh token (longer life, rotation on use)
  - On request to protected resource: validate access token; if expired, prompt client to refresh

# Session Management

## Overview
Build a secure, scalable session and token management system that issues short-lived access tokens and long-lived, rotatable refresh tokens, enforces single-use refresh tokens, supports token blacklisting/revocation, and provides device/session management with remote sign-out. Integrate with a user profile page, settings, and an admin dashboard. Ensure secure cookies, robust validation, auditability, and a smooth UX aligned with Archject’s design system.

## Components to Build
1) Session Management Service
- Token issuance (access tokens, refresh tokens)
- Refresh token rotation and single-use enforcement
- Token blacklist/revocation store (Redis)
- Token validation middleware
- Device and session tracking (IP, user agent, device fingerprint)
- Remote sign-out / revoke by admin or user
- Secure cookie handling (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)

2) Profile Page – Session & Devices
- List active sessions/devices per user
- View details (device, last used, IP, app, OS, browser)
- Revoke individual sessions or all except current
- Sign out from all devices with a single action
- Web and mobile-safe presentation

3) Settings / Preferences
- Account and workspace settings integration
- API keys management (generation, rotation, revocation)
- Billing-related toggles (enable/disable, plan status)
- Branding settings (logo, color tokens, theme)
- Notification preferences (email, push, webhooks)
- Data export (workspace export request and status)

4) Admin Dashboard
- Platform-wide accounts management
- Monitoring usage metrics, quotas, and requests
- System health indicators (uptime, error rates, Redis health)
- Token/revocation audit trails and security events
- Admins can suspend/unsuspend accounts, revoke tokens, and force sign-out

5) API Layer and Persistence
- REST/GraphQL endpoints for token lifecycle, sessions, admin actions
- Database tables for sessions, devices, tokens (with TTLs and audit fields)
- Redis-backed blacklist/revocation store
- Audit logging with immutable or append-only approach

6) Frontend Integration
- User profile page: sessions listing and actions
- Settings page: API keys, branding, notifications, export
- Admin dashboard: users, sessions, system health, logs
- Secure, responsive UI that follows the design system

7) Security & Compliance
- CSRF protection for cookie-based flows
- JWT signing with strong algorithms (RS256 or ES256)
- Refresh token rotation with one-time use enforcement
- Blacklist checks on access token validation
- IP/domain restrictions where applicable
- Security logging and alerting hooks
